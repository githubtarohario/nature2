Professor: Good morning. I'm sure everyone did the homework reading, so I want to begin today's
class on intercultural communication. My first question is "Why do we need to study
intercultural communication?" Would anyone like to answer?
Student 1: Yes, I'll try to answer that. People may think the way they do things or the way they view
the world is "natural" and "correct." When they encounter someone doing things
differently, they regard it as "strange" or "wrong." Having an awareness of intercultural
communication can help us understand and deal with misunderstandings when they arise. I
think it is especially important these days because people travel overseas for many reasons,
such as work, study, or vacations. The opportunities to meet people from other countries
have increased greatly. With this increased contact, there are more chances for trouble
between people from different cultures.
Professor: Right. As you said, studying intercultural communication is useful because I 32 I.
c intercultural knowledge encourages people to study in a foreign country
(D some ways of living are considered to be more correct than others
(D there were many more cases of intercultural communication in the past
c we can cope with cultural misunderstandings more easily and smoothly
Professor: Let's move on to the concept of "culture." You should know that because culture is all
around us all the time, it is difficult to define. Therefore, we tend to discuss culture in
terms of characteristics. Can anyone give an example of a cultural characteristic?
Student 2: The characteristic I found interesting is that people belonging to a culture have the same
values, beliefs, and behaviors. Values are things that are felt to be of worth, like the
Japanese concept of "mottainai." Beliefs are things that people believe to be true, and
these cover a wide variety of areas. For example, people in a culture might share beliefs
about the kinds of foods that are unacceptable. Behavior is about people's actions, and
people in the same culture can often be seen behaving similarly.
Professor: That's a good explanation. That means I 33 I.
c having the same beliefs as other cultural groups is important
<D people from the same cultural group usually behave differently
(3) people's attitudes to food determine which cultures they are from
@ shared behaviors may make you a member of a cultural group
Student 3: Can I ask a question?
Professor: Of course.
Student 3: What about people who always seem to be different from those around them? Sometimes I
don't do things in the same way as my friends. So, if we need to have the same behavior
for group membership, does that mean those who are not the same aren't members of their
cultural group?
Professor: That's a good question. To answer it we need to think in terms of cultural norms rather
than individual examples.
Student 3: What is a cultural norm?
Professor: Well, a cultural norm is a rule or standard of behavior shared by members of a cultural
group.
Student 3: Then what happens to the people who do not follow the cultural norms?
Professor: Well, they may belong to a smaller group, or a sub-cultural group, but that group is still
considered to be part of the culture. This is true as long as their actions are within the
ISXtt 2017

acceptable limits of behavior for that particular culture.
Student 3: So, am I right in thinking that I 34 I?
c a culture contains groups that make up one larger group
(2) acting differently isn't allowed for group membership
c it is important to be in the group that follows the cultural norms
@ the number of sub-cultural groups should be limited
Professor: Yes. I hope this has cleared things up for you. OK. I think we're ready to move on and
think about another characteristic of culture.

US consumers have benefited from an increased volume and variety of fresh-fruit imports,
particularly since the 1990s. The fruit and vegetable section in today's grocery store often has dozens
of different fresh fruits on display all year around, which come from all corners of the globe as
additions to domestic fresh fruit.
The rapid growth of fresh-fruit imports has affected many aspects of the US fresh-fruit market. For
example, while oranges are the US's leading domestically grown fruit, the volume of US orange
imports has grown steadily since the 1990s, with occasional sudden increases when the US crop
experienced freezing weather (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. US fresh-orange imports by country.

The US domestic market receives orange imports from various countries and regions. Among the
major suppliers, Mexico is a longtime source. However, due to the strong US demand for fresh
oranges throughout the year, the Southern Hemisphere countries have also become major suppliers,
especially during the summer months when domestic navel oranges are not available. Australia was
the first such country, starting in the early 1990s after it obtained permission from the US government
to export its navel oranges there. Australia was followed by South Africa in the late 1990s, and most
recently by Chile as well.
In the US, two main types of oranges are produced domestically: "navel oranges" and "Valencia
oranges." Navel oranges Å\ virtually without seeds, with flesh that separates easily and is firm rather
than watery Å\ are the most popular oranges for eating fresh. The navel orange share of US
production of fresh-market oranges was 76 percent during the years 2010-2012. In comparison,
Valencia oranges Å\ with thin skins, containing occasional seeds, and with juicy and sweet flesh Å\
accounted for 24 percent during the same period. As the US's top supplier of fresh-market oranges,
California produced 87 percent of fresh-market navel oranges and more than 81 percent of fresh-
market Valencia oranges.
The main harvest period for domestic fresh-market oranges is from November through May, a time
when California's navel oranges are in season. However, the amount of oranges produced and shipped
domestically falls significantly from June through October. In earlier years, when fresh-orange imports
still accounted for only a small portion of domestic use, Valencia oranges were a popular variety when
navel oranges were out of season. As seen in Figure 2, however, navel orange imports from the
Southern Hemisphere countries have come to dominate the US in the summer season.

Figure 2. Seasonal relationship between imported and domestic oranges (2010-2012 average).

Because of seasonal production patterns, the majority of Mexico's oranges arrive in the US market
from December through June, when US supplies are relatively high. In contrast, the season for
imports from the Southern Hemisphere countries is mainly from July through October, when US
supplies are relatively low. This trend is similar to that seen with many other fruits as well.

"No one thought I would amount to much," Uncle John said, as he stood in the kitchen, showing me
how he put together an award-winning four-course dinner. I had just graduated from university, and this
dinner was his gift to me. It felt great to have a well-known chef cooking for me. On top of this, I was
excited because in a few days he was going to compete in The Big-Time Cook Off, a nationwide TV
cooking contest.
When Uncle John was young, his family lived in the countryside. His mother taught at a local school,
but when John was 10, she had to quit to take care of her elderly mother. Until then, his father had
been kind and had had enough time to play with John and his two younger sisters. But as bills kept
piling up, the family got into trouble. John's father finally had to take a job in a city far away, so he
could only come home on the weekends.
Gradually, because of his busy work schedule, John's father began looking tired whenever he came
home. To tell the truth, he had changed from being good-humored to being in a bad mood all the time.
When he was home, he just wanted to rest. He often scolded John for small things. Wanting to be
accepted by his father, John tried to do his best but never felt he was good enough. Eventually, he
• EXtt 2017
-13

started avoiding his father. He began hanging out at the shopping mall with friends, sometimes skipping his
classes. Little by little John's grades got worse. His parents and teachers were worried about his future.
One Sunday morning, while John's mom was out taking care of her own mother, his father was
napping in the TV room. John's sisters were hungry, so John started to cook something for them. He
was not sure how to cook, but he did not want to bother his father.
Suddenly, the kitchen door opened, and his father was standing there. "Dad, I'm sorry if I woke you
up. Chelsea and Jessica are hungry, and I was trying to cook them some eggs." His dad looked at him
seriously for a moment. "Eggs? Eggs aren't good for lunch on a beautiful Sunday like today. Let's grill
some steaks in the backyard." "Are you sure? You must be tired." "It's OK. I like cooking. It reminds me
of my college days when I worked part-time as a cook. I'll show you how to prepare delicious steaks."
To John's surprise, his father became energetic when he started cooking. He took John aside and
explained to him in detail that cooking was, in a way, like a science project. "You need to measure the
ingredients precisely and know which items go together. If you master this, you can provide pleasure for
a great many people." John felt close to his father for the first time in a long time. From then on, John spent
more time at home. He started cooking for his family regularly, and then later for his friends at college.
John always felt happy when he cooked, and this happiness spilled over into other areas of his life.
Uncle John worked his way through college with jobs in restaurants, and eventually he became a chef
at a famous restaurant. He really liked the job and worked hard developing his own special techniques.
He was finally able to open his own restaurant serving his unique style of food. He won several awards
and cooked for the rich and famous.
This brings us back to the contest. Uncle John and I were excited about his being selected. Yet, he
shared something really touching with me there in the kitchen. "You know, Mike," Uncle John said,
"I'm thrilled to be able to go on TV as part of The Big-Time Cook Off. But what makes me the happiest
is to stand here with you, one of the people I care about, and talk Å\ just you and me. It's exactly like
what my dad did for me one fine day in summer, so many years ago. And that made all the difference in
my life."

(1) Opera is an art form that celebrates the human voice at its highest level of expression. No other art
form creates excitement and moves the heart in the way that opera does, especially when performed
by a great singer. Such singers are trained to present some of the greatest and most challenging music
that has ever been composed for the human voice.
(2) Opera is an important part of the Western classical music tradition. It uses music, words, and
actions to bring a dramatic story to life. Opera started in Italy at the end of the 16th century and later
became popular throughout Europe. Over the years, it has responded to various musical and
theatrical developments around the world and continues to do so. In recent decades, much wider
audiences have been introduced to opera through modern recording technology. Some singers have
become celebrities thanks to performing on radio, on television, and in the cinema.
(3) However, in recent years, opera has been facing serious challenges. The causes of some of these are
beyond its control. One current challenge to opera is economic. The current world economic
slowdown has meant that less money is available for cultural institutions and artists. This shortage of
0EJttt2O17ÅíB*^AStlHSjESI 9

14
money raises the broader question of how much should be paid to support opera singers and other
artists. Society seems to accept the large salaries paid to business managers and the multi-million-
dollar contracts given to sports athletes. But what about opera singers? Somehow, people have the
idea that artists can be creative only if they suffer in poverty, but this is unrealistic: If artists, including
opera singers, lack the support they need, valuable talent is wasted.
(4) Not only the shortage of money, but also the way money is managed in the opera world has led to
hardships. Principal singers are generally paid performance fees once they complete a show. They
typically receive nothing during the many weeks of rehearsal before a show starts. To prepare for a
role, they must pay the costs of lessons and coaching sessions. If they become ill or cancel their
performance, they lose their performance fee. The insecurity of this system puts the future of opera at
risk.
(5) Another problem faced by opera is how to meet the demands of audiences who are influenced by
popular entertainment. Pop singers are often judged as much on the basis of how they look as how
they sound. Therefore, opera singers, performing to audiences influenced by this popular culture, are
now expected to be "models who sing." These demands may be unrealistic and possibly harmful.
Opera singers simply cannot make a sound big enough to fill a large theater or concert hall without a
microphone if their body weight is too low. Emphasizing physical appearance over singing ability may
cause audiences to miss out on the human voice at its best.
(6) There are no easy solutions to opera's problems and there are many different opinions about the
value of opera. However, every year many young people register for music courses with hopes and
dreams of developing their talents in this special art form. The fact that opera has survived many
obstacles and continues to attract the rising generation demonstrates that it remains a respected art
form full of value.

El In the past, zoos were places where we saw single animals in small, empty cages. Today zoos are
changing in design; animals have more space, and some live in groups. Many zoos try to put animals in
( 1 ) that is similar to where they live in the wild. Some people who believe in animal rights argue
against having zoos, because they think it is wrong to put animals in cages. I support the idea of having
zoos, because they allow us to see wild animals that we cannot see ^otherwise, and they help
endangered species from becoming extinct.
The first reason for having zoos is that they allow people to see wild animals that they could not see
otherwise. Zoos are the only places for most people who live in cities to see wild animals. Seeing wild
animals on nature documentary programs or in books is not the same thing as seeing animals in ( 3 ).
Zoos educate people about wild animals and teach them to understand and care about them. That is
why there are school trips to the zoo, where the zookeepers tell students about the animals.
Secondly, many endangered species would become extinct if we did not have zoos. Zoos have saved
numerous species from dying out or have helped animals get healthier and returned them to the wild.
( 4 ), zoos have a valuable role to play: they have an educational role and help to preserve certain
species. It is important for animals to be treated well and kept in an environment which is as natural as
possible. Many zoos today are responding to their critics and changing the way they keep animals so
that they can continue their role without harming animals.

Last month, France Å\ including Paris, the "City of Light" Å\ grew darker at night as one of the
world's most comprehensive lighting laws went into effect. From 1 a.m. to 7 a.m., shop lights are being
turned off, and lights inside office buildings must be turned off within an hour of employees leaving the
workplace. The lighting on France's building fronts cannot be turned on before sunset. Over the next
two years, rules restricting lights on signs will also go into effect. These rules are designed to cut carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions by 250,000 tons per year, save as much as the annual energy consumption of
750,000 households, and dramatically cut the country's overall energy bill by 200 million Euros.
Despite such benefits, one might well wonder why the French Å\ and potentially all of us Å\ should
care much about light pollution in the first place. After all, doesn't light at night make our lives safer
and expand our work and play time? Isn't that more important than saving a bit of money or making a
small cut in CO2 emissions?
France's Environment Ministry took steps because, on the contrary, excessive lighting in major cities
and in many parts of the world threatens our health and the health of the natural environments on which
we rely. In his book, The End of Night, Paul Bogard agrees. Bogard reminds us that, until recently,
efforts to limit our use of light have been made in response to complaints that we have lost our starry
nights. Practical need to see stars in the night sky for navigation and star-gazing scientists' research
exists side by side with the artist's desire to paint the magic of the night sky in artwork or poetry.
Remember that famous painting by the Dutch artist Van Gogh, for instance. How tragic to think we

might have no more "Starry Nights"!
Besides science and art, though, other researchers pay attention to the impacts of light pollution on
our health, warning that disturbing these natural patterns of light and dark, and thus the structures and
functions of natural environments, is having deep impacts on humans, creatures, and even plant life.
Scientists are investigating new ways to provide society with the light it demands for security and
commerce while greatly reducing the flood of light that is increasingly disturbing human health and the
ability of many creatures to function.
Some 30 percent of vertebrates (animals with backbones) and more than 60 percent of invertebrates
(those without) are nocturnal, coming out only at night. Many of the rest are active at dawn and dusk,
the borders of day and night. All life potentially feels the impacts of our exploding use of artificial light,
scientists say.
Every time we humans switch on a light, many animals' age-old patterns of mating, travel, and feeding
are altered, often with no time for species to adjust. On the Caribbean island of Tobago, a 2012 study of
leatherback turtles* Å\ a species that has been on Earth for 150 million years Å\ found that artificial light
on the nesting beaches is the biggest threat to survival of newly born turtles. This is a major factor in
declining leatherback turtle populations. Newly born turtles have evolved to follow the reflected light of
the stars and moon from the beach to the ocean. But they now follow the light of hotels and streetlights
instead. As a result they die of lack of water, are eaten by other animals, or get run over by cars.
Every year more and more birds traveling long distances are drawn away from their seasonal courses
by artificial light, then killed by flying into buildings. Other recent studies show that artificial light
disturbs patterns of travel and feeding for bats precisely because many bat species avoid lighted areas.
According to a 2011 study in the journal Science, bats benefit U.S. agriculture by billions of dollars
annually, simply by eating insects.
Of course, "humans are animals as well," explains Steven Lockley of Harvard Medical School's
Division of Sleep Medicine, "and so when light/dark cycles disturb seasonal patterns of trees or breeding
cycles of animals, there's no reason to think it's not doing the same to us." As recently as 1980, humans
were thought to be safe from the effects of artificial light at night. But continuing research has shown
that light at night troubles our sleep and confuses our circadian rhythms, those 24-hour biological
processes that control our body's functions. Technological advances such as LEDs (light-emitting diodes)
can improve our ability to reduce and better control lighting, but these same new lights may actually
make things worse because they contain a "blue-rich" white light that especially disturbs circadian rhythms.
More and more of the light we see at night Å\ whether on our electronic phones and tablets or in
outdoor lighting Å\ is rich with the blue wavelengths most disturbing to our body's rhythms. (More than
any other wavelengths, blue light tells our brain that night is over, that morning's blue sky has returned,
and that the day has begun Å\ the opposite signal that we want to be sending our brain in the middle of
the night.) Studies continue to suggest that the consequences of excessive exposure to light at night
include a risk for weight gain, heart disease, and other serious health problems. Last year, the American
Medical Association called for research into the "risks and benefits of workplace and environmental
exposure to light-at-night," and recommended "new lighting technologies at home and at work that take
into account the body's clock." In fact, researchers are concerned about the impact of some new lighting
technologies. LEDs are praised for being energy-efficient and clearer in color. But most LEDs are
actually brighter than the old lights, further increasing light pollution. In fact, LEDs could worsen the
effects of light pollution on human health and the environment by more than five times.
The problem is worsening as China, India, Brazil, and many other countries become increasingly
wealthy and urbanized. Satellite views of Earth at night show vast areas of the planet glowing white,
with only the world's furthest regions still covered in darkness. Some countries have passed regulations
to reduce light pollution, but most nations and cities still do little to slow down the increasing use of
excessive light
The simple act of shielding (changing the amount and direction of light) helps to control light pollution.
While we seldom use lamps without lamp shades inside our homes, most of our outdoor lighting remains
unshielded, sending light straight into the sky, into our eyes, into our neighbors' bedrooms. Until
recently, consumers had few buying choices, but now some stores offer shielded lighting. Street lighting,
stadium lighting, parking lot and gas station lighting Å\ all can now be shielded.
But then again, don't we need all this light for safety and security? Light equals safety, and darkness
danger Å\ right? This common belief alone helps to explain why many gas stations and parking lots are
lit more than ten times as brightly as they were just 20 years ago, and why light pollution continues to
grow at up to 20 percent per year. In fact, the issue of light at night and safety is complex, with little
good evidence to support these common beliefs. For example, ever brighter lights can actually reduce
security, blinding our vision. And anyway, like everyone else, criminals too fear the dark as unsafe,
seeking well-lit areas for their dark acts.

It is far more important to use light effectively than simply to use a lot of light. Explaining France's
new lighting rules, former environment minister Delphine Batho said that the government would like to
"change the culture" to include responsible use of light. This change will be welcome, for what experts
and studies Å\ not to mention our own eyes Å\ tell us is that we are using far more light than we need,
and at tremendous cost.

E9 What is communicating, and why do we communicate? According to Rudolph F. Verderber,
author of several books on communication, "communicating" is sharing meaning. The word "sharing" is
of key importance and indicates why communication is basic to human society. People must
communicate Å\ share meaning Å\ in order to establish relationships and complete tasks. At least two

-20-
people must interact with each other for sharing to take place. This interaction involves sending,
receiving, and responding to messages, which may be verbal (that is, spoken), or nonverbal (for instance,
nodding your head to show that you are listening to what is being said). ,.When communicating with
others, you have responsibilities both as a speaker and a listener, and the more actively you are able to

actually, being an active
listener is just as vital. What does it mean to be an active listener? It means that you focus both
physical and mental energy on what a speaker is saying. Merely sitting passively, hearing but not
consciously attending, seriously limits your ability to absorb and interpret information accurately. Active
listening is the only way to come close to understanding what a speaker is saying; it means paying

Vocal communication in birds is usually divided into two types, songs and calls. Songs are long,
elaborated vocalizations with melodic tones, predominantly produced by male song birds, and mostly
during the breeding season. They often happen spontaneously (i.e., are not triggered by a particular
event in the environment) and have a typical daily rhythm. Calls, on the other hand, are shorter and
simpler sounds that may be produced by both males and females all year round. Calls are often
reactions to changes in the environment and they express a range of different functions, such as alarm,
flight or discovery of a food source. However, calls are also used for individual recognition and are
therefore subject to variation at the same time as they serve as signals.
Birds need to communicate to find a partner, keep away competitors, bring up a family, warn against
predators, inform about food sources and keep contact during migration and other movements. These
functions are fulfilled in different channels: hearing, sight, and touch.
The most striking communicative behaviors in birds are the vocalizations Å\ and among the
vocalizations, the songs of the song birds are particularly conspicuous. Most songs are performed when
males are looking for partners, and the expression can be interpreted as an announcement like, "Listen, I
am a sparrow and this is my territory. I want to raise a family here so females are welcome but males
should beware." The song in the sparrows and the crowing in the crows are both stimulated by the male
hormone, to attract a female and to defend a territory. The biological value of the vocalization among
crows is shown by the fact that the males that crow the most also have the highest reproduction rate.
Songs are sometimes monologues, but they can also come out in the form of dialogues, with
interaction and alignment between individuals. In species with large song repertoires, males often
engage in what is called matched counter-singing, or song sharing, for example by replying to a
neighbor's song with a similar song, or, if his song is well-known, even by singing the next song in the
sequence, thereby taking over the initiative. To counter the song of a neighbor in this way can be
considered a challenge, and evoke a response of aggression, but it has also been noted to result in social
success in terms of increased chances to attract a mate.
Counter-singing interactions are common between neighbors. To get to know the neighbor and his
song repertoire is a good strategy since it is an advantage to have familiar neighbors and well established
territories, the so called "dear enemy" effect. To know the neighbor's song repertoire gives the male full
control over the interaction and he can choose whether to escalate or de-escalate.
Counter-singing is an example of an interaction between males and it can be used in territorial
disputes. Another kind of cooperative singing, which maybe is more similar to human alignment or
synchronization, is the duets between male and female. One difference between duets and counter-
singing in males is that the duets have a more precise timing, with a fair amount of overlapping between
phrases. "Indeed, while phrases may overlap, the sounds themselves may not do so, the birds fitting
their sounds together so precisely that it is hard to believe that more than one individual is involved"
(Catchpole & Slater 1995:174). Duets are acoustic, but do not have to be vocal, since they can also
involve the drumming of woodpeckers. Their functions are assumed to be pair-bonding, at the same
time as territory-claiming, since they catch a stable relationship and signal to other males to keep away.
Singing duets is most commonly found in the tropics, where the birds do not migrate, but have relatively
constant territories the year round. Other features that are typical of duetting birds are that females also
sing and that there are permanent pair-bonds.
Songs are typical expressions for advertising, mating, and defending territory, which constitute the
reproductive function. However, birds may also communicate about an external event, that is, use the
referential function. In a series of experiments on communication in the domestic fowl it was
demonstrated that they produce calls that convey precise information about predators, as well as about
accessible food resources. For predator warnings, there are different calls for enemy from the ground
and enemy from the air. When these calls were played back to hens in an experimental setting, totally
different effects were found. The reaction to a ground alarm call is to stand up and scan the ground to
detect an enemy, whereas the reaction to an aerial alarm call is to look upwards, crouch down with head

and tail lowered.
To investigate the exact meaning of an alarm, one of the experiments included video images, where
animated sequences of a ground predator (a fox) and an aerial predator (a hawk) were displayed. The
images were placed in different places, at ground level and over the cage with the male chicken (i.e., fox
on the ground and fox in the air and hawk on the ground and hawk in the air). When the predators
were placed at unusual positions, there were fewer calls produced. The hawk elicited mostly aerial calls
no matter where it was placed (even though there were some attempts at ground calls when it was placed
on the ground). The responses to the fox were mixed: while it elicited only ground calls when it was
placed on the ground, there were more aerial calls than ground calls when it was positioned overhead. A
possible explanation for this apparent confusion is that some contextual information was missed in the
ground position, since the image was constructed in such a way as to have a neutral background, and the
chicken probably expects more background information on the ground (e.g., bushes) than from the
silhouettes in the air.
Another call with a referential function is the food call. These calls are produced when food is
discovered, alerting their fellows that there is a food source to be shared. In the domestic fowl, the
response to a food call is a downward movement and ground inspection. The use of food calls is
interesting from many aspects. The fact that the calls are used much more when there is an audience at
hand than when the caller is alone, shows that the calls are not just automated reflexes, but directed
towards a potential listener. There is an audience effect, i.e., the audience influences the behavior. But
why attract others to a food source you can eat all by yourself? One suggestion is that bringing more
birds together diminishes the risk for the caller to be attacked by a predator. However, this explanation
does not fit the results from domestic fowls, since the males are known to call more when there is a
female around than when there is a male. This suggests multifunctionality Å\ a food call can function as
a courting call in certain contexts.
The studies of audience effects have broadened the scope of communicative functions found in birds.
If not only humans but also animals are able to consider the effects of their communicative behavior, and
help others in defense and finding food, some kind of mutual aid could even be involved, so that they
help others in order to get help when they need it. However, the whole discussion of communicative
functions in animals is flawed by the fact that we don't really know what goes on in the minds of the
individuals, since all we have is their behavior and our interpretations.

E9 Mahatma Gandhi said that the real goal of education is to bring out the best in people. Wherever
we go in the world, we find that educators agree on this as an important goal of education. And when
we speak with school principals or teacher educators, they ( 11 ) say that it is crucial to bring out the
best in teachers. Yet, in spite of this general consensus around the goal of bringing out the best in
others, a lot of confusion seems to exist when it comes to the question of how to do this. Although
almost everyone in education holds the ideal of ( 12 ) others in their growth, people try to do so in
many different ways.
For a long time, many people have thought that the best way to "bring out the best" was to confront
people with what was not going well and then try to help them improve. This is what we call the
deficiency model: you try to "( 13 )" what is weak. This model is strongly intertwined with almost
every aspect of education. Look, for example, at how a teacher assesses her students after completing a
test. Very few teachers write positive remarks in the margin at places where the students have done
well. Or observe an evaluative meeting between a school principal and a teacher that focuses on
assessing the teacher's instructional planning and implementation. ( 14 ), most of the time in such a
meeting is devoted to what could be improved in the teacher's behavior and not to an in-depth analysis
of the teacher's strengths. But there are some positive exceptions. Some school principals have
discovered that professional growth among educators is strongly promoted if the evaluative emphasis is
( 15 ) what goes well and how this can be extended.
The deficiency model in education is grounded in a more general view of human growth that has
influenced our society as a whole, probably as a result of this ( 16 ) view in psychology. During the
twentieth century, psychologists have become better and better at mapping and diagnosing abnormalities
and traumas in people, at searching for causes to be found in people's life histories, and at finding and
prescribing treatments. The idea was that as soon as we know what exactly is the problem with a
person, we then may find a solution and "cure" the person. Martin Seligman, who was the president of
the American Psychology Association around the turn of the twenty-first century, took a ( 17 ) the
deficit orientation that was common among almost all of his psychologist colleagues. Together with
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who is well known for his publications on the concept of flow, Seligman wrote
an often quoted article stating that for too long, psychology had focused on disease, weakness, and the
damage done to people. According to these two influential psychologists, a critical review of the
psychologist literature showed that the deficiency model has not been very effective in enhancing
people's well-being.
Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi emphasized that psychology had insufficiently acknowledged the human
potential. Since the year 2000, Seligman has supported the development of a completely new direction
in psychology, called positive psychology, which focuses on people's strengths as the fundamental basis
for growth. Seligman speaks about nurturing people's psychological capital in order to help them
develop resilience, the capacity to ( 18 ) and to see new opportunities in times of trouble. In the end,
this makes people happier, or, to say it in more scientific terms, it enhances people's well-being.
Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi emphasized that "treatment is not just fixing what is broken; it is
nurturing what is best." Hence, they pointed to the importance of positive traits in individuals, which
they call character strengths, such as creativity, courage, perseverance, kindness, and fairness. Central
issues in positive psychology are ( 19 ), and enhancing resilience and well-being. These seem to be

issues that are also highly relevant for education.
What has become clear through the work of researchers in positive psychology is that we can influence
our own well-being, not by just digging into our problems and trying to "solve" them, but by ( 20 ) our
strengths, our psychological capital.

El As most people no doubt noticed given that they were robbed of an hour of sleep, Sunday marked
the beginning of Daylight Saving Time in the United States, Canada, and several other countries. For
morning people, Daylight Saving is a drag, ( 21 ) them of an hour of tranquil morning light. But for
others, "spring forward" brings with it the promise of long, lazy afternoons and warmer weather.
Like millions of other Americans who have walked heavily through an uncomfortably cold winter, I'm
looking forward to the change of season. But Daylight Saving Time is an annual tradition whose time
has passed. In contemporary society, it's not only unnecessary: it's also wasteful, cruel, and dangerous.
And it's long past time to bid it goodbye.
Daylight Saving has been an official ritual since 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson codified it into
law during the days of World War I. Nowadays, its apparent purpose is to ( 22 ): One more hour of
sunlight in the evening means one less hour of consumption of artificial lighting. In 2005, President
George W. Bush lengthened Daylight Saving Time by a month as part of a sweeping energy bill signed
that year, citing the need to reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil.
But does Daylight Saving Time actually make much of a difference? Evidence suggests that the answer
is ( 23 ). After the Australian government extended Daylight Saving Time by two months in 2000 in
order to accommodate the Sydney Olympic Games, a study at University of California, Berkeley, showed
that the move failed to reduce electricity demand at all. More recently, a study of homes in Indiana Å\ a
state that adopted Daylight Saving Time only in 2006 Å\ showed that the savings from electricity use
were not as great as the additional use of air conditioning and heat.
The simple fact of ( 24 ) to the time change, however subtle, also has measurable consequences.
Many people feel the effects of the "spring forward" for longer than a day; a study showed that
Americans lose around 40 minutes of sleep on the Sunday night after the shift. This means more than
just additional yawns on Monday: the resulting loss in productivity costs the economy an estimated $434
million a year.
Daylight Savings Time may also hurt people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, robbing
them of light in the mornings. The switchover to Daylight Savings Time is also linked to an increase in
heart attacks as well as traffic accidents.
Those of us who have lived with Daylight Savings Time our whole lives might feel disoriented without
it. But the millions of Americans in Arizona, Hawaii, and territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
U.S. Virgin Islands have survived just fine without it. Not to mention the billions of people throughout
Asia, Africa, and South America.
It's said that Benjamin Franklin first proposed a version of Daylight Savings back in 1784 as a way to
save candles. This, no disrespect to old Ben, should tell us how ( 25 ) the tradition has become.
President Obama Å\ and leaders elsewhere in the world Å\ should do the sensible thing and scrap it.

Off the coast of Western Australia, three big buoys floating beneath the ocean's surface look like
giant jellyfish tethered to the seafloor. The steel machines, 36 feet wide, are buffeted by the powerful
waves of the Indian Ocean. By harnessing the constant motion of the waves, the buoys generate about
5 percent of the electricity used at a nearby military base on Garden Island. The buoys are a pilot
project of Carnegie Wave Energy, a company based in Perth. In late February, the buoys started
supplying 240 kilowatts each to the electricity grid at Australia's largest naval base. They also help run a
desalination plant that transforms seawater into about one-third of the base's fresh water supply.
Renewable energy is not an urgent matter in Australia, given the country's plentiful supplies of fossil
fuels, particularly coal. But Carnegie's demonstration project is ultimately aimed at island nations that
must import expensive fuel for electricity, as well as military bases looking to ^bolster energy and water
security. "Island nations are all looking to be sustainable," said Michael Ottaviano, chief executive of
Carnegie. Wave energy could be a good fit, especially for islands where tropical clouds impede solar
power or where wind turbines disturb the aesthetics of tourist destinations.
,A1 Given the ocean's power, wave energy seems a promising source of renewable energy. Over the last
two decades, companies have developed various designs, including a snakelike apparatus with hinged
joints from Pelamis Wave Power; a tubelike device from Ocean Power Technologies of New Jersey and
bobbing buoys from AWS Ocean Energy of Scotland. But wave energy remains largely experimental.
The equipment is easily damaged by (f)relentless waves and strong storms. And there is a ^scarcity of
large investments needed to refine and test designs. In a blow to the industry, Pelamis collapsed late last
year after it failed to secure ^adequate financing. "The biggest challenge is funding," said Mr.
Ottaviano. "Any power generation product is capital-intensive. Anytime you want to test an idea, it
costs millions of dollars." "Energy technologies that are mainstream today, like nuclear power, were
developed for commercial use with government research and support," he said.
Carnegie's pilot project, named Ceto 5 after the Greek sea goddess Ceto, began with more than $30
million in financing from investors and the Australian government, including $13.1 million from the
Australian Renewable Energy Agency and $7.3 million from the Low Emissions Energy Development
Program. Carnegie has been working on its Ceto technology since 1999, with cumulative investment of
more than $100 million. To battle the elements that make wave energy so difficult to produce, this
technology differs from most other wave energy designs. Its buoys sit three to six feet underwater,
rather than float on the surface. This helps,. .shield the equipment from pounding waves. Mr. Ottaviano,
who grew up in Perth, near the ocean, said, "m,Everyone knows when you see a wave the intuitive
is to dive underneath."
The constant rocking of the ocean drives hydraulic pumps that push seawater and other liquids
through a pipe to a power plant nearly two miles away on Garden Island. There, the high-pressure water
turns standard hydroelectric turbines, which power a generator. Wave energy from the buoys also
pumps high-pressure water through the desalination plant, without using fossil fuels. In contrast, many
desalination plants use diesel fuel or electricity to pump saltwater at high pressure through membranes
to yield fresh water.
Carnegie is already planning to start using larger, better-designed buoys in 2017 that could each generate
one megawatt of electricity. The new technology, called Ceto 6, would use buoys 65 feet wide that could
produce four times the energy of the current prototype. The new technology would generate electricity
inside the buoy instead of at an onshore power plant. The electricity would be carried to shore by
underwater cables, rather than by pumping water through a pipe. These larger buoys would also sit in
deeper water, more than seven miles from shore, where waves are larger and have more energy. The
newer buoys would be easier to maintain because they would be m self-contained units that could be
towed back to shore. Ceto 5 uses heavy machinery on the sea floor next to each pump to smooth the flow
of the piped water. Because no water is pumped with the newer buoys, this equipment is not needed.
Ceto 6 is expected to generate 30 to 40 percent of the naval base's electricity at a cheaper rate.
Carnegie estimates that using the improved buoys in large wave farms of 100 megawatts would reduce
rates to 12 to 15 cents a kilowatt-hour Å\ a price comparable to commercial electricity in the state of
Western Australia. But on a small scale, wave energy is still costly. Carnegie's current design generates
electricity at a cost of about 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. "This is competitive with electricity from diesel."
said Mr. Ottaviano, "hence Carnegie's focus on island nations that rely on diesel." "What is needed is a
well-thought-out wave energy strategy by governments, but which no country has yet formulated. The

A legal change has made it likely that some third-year high school students will become eligible to
vote in next year's House of Councillors election, but little has been done so far to prepare these new
voters for the important decisions they will make at the ballot box.
Educating these youths about their new voting rights is made more urgent by the persistently low
turnout of young voters overall. Unfortunately, only a handful of high schools are offering information
on voting and elections. Many remain unsure how to broach the subject in class while respecting the
political neutrality of education.
Such concerns came to the fore recently when the upper house voted to lower the voting age from 20
to 18 by revising the Public Offices Election Law. The change will likely take effect ahead of an upper
house election in the summer of 2016.
One school that has taken steps to prepare students to take part in elections is Igusa Metropolitan High
School in Nerima Ward, Tokyo. The school has held several ,,mock elections designed to increase
students' awareness of the election process. The first was held in 2012. Students "voted" in the school's
version of the Tokyo gubernatorial and national House of Representatives elections that were held in
December of that year. The students cast votes for actual candidates and parties and the event was
timed to coincide with the real-life polls.
The students chose for themselves whom to vote for after learning that there were different views on
some issues by reading candidates' election pledges and comparing content from various newspapers.
The school also held a mock election for the December 2014 lower house election. Though
participation in the mock elections was voluntary and voting was held after school hours, more than 70
percent of the student body cast ballots Å\ a high percentage compared with actual voter turnout in
recent elections.
"I'd like to hear what the candidates have to say with my own ears," one student said.
Mr. A, a civics teacher at Igusa High School, said he felt the school's mock elections had heightened
students' awareness of the importance of participating in the political process. "This project wasn't as
difficult as I had expected. I hope more schools will follow our example," said Mr. A.
Mr. B, an associate professor at the University of Tsukuba and an expert in social studies education,
said it was vital that Igusa's efforts be replicated elsewhere.
"To nurture socially responsible voters, teachers need to clear away the walls between the classroom
and society, and they need to willingly handle politics and topical issues," Mr. B said.

Holding mock elections is one method advocated by the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology Ministry to raise interest in elections, but so far only a handful of schools have followed
Igusa's example.
"There are many other things we have to teach," a teacher at a private high school in Tokyo said.
"We can only touch briefly on the voting system and the significance of an election."
Such sentiments are expressed in the context of ^a curriculum that tends to prioritize preparation for
university entrance exams and shy away from instruction on substantive political issues in deference to
preserving the political neutrality of education.
For teachers, this can be a tricky balancing act.
"I think elections are wonderful as practical teaching material, but we have to be highly sensitive when
handling these issues," admitted a 55-year-old civics teacher at a high school in Tokyo.

allowed to mention the names of political parties and
pledges or key election issues. Other gray areas have
"I want the central government to clearly stipulate what points we need to be careful about when we
discuss elections in class," another teacher said.
At high schools that have conducted several of these mock elections, teachers avoid simply drilling
information into the students. They must stay conscious of the need to remain ( b ) and make students
think for themselves by providing balanced instruction on the campaign pledges made by each party.
This can be ( c ) task for inexperienced teachers and school administrations.

The Education Ministry and the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry are hurriedly preparing
a manual for teachers and new supplementary material for high schools to help them teach students
about the lower voting age.
"We hope to distribute them before the start of the third term," a senior official of the Education
Ministry said.
However, it will be difficult to set aside instruction time on this topic for third-year students after the
New Year comes around, and there will only be about six months between this time and when the
current batch of second-year students who could become eligible to vote will actually go to the polls.
Given these time constraints, the Education Ministry is particularly concerned about ensuring that high
school students do not inadvertently violate election laws.
Third-year classes at high school contain a mix of 18-year-olds who may soon be allowed to vote, and
17-year-olds who will still be too young. An 18-year-old can legally take part in campaigns to spread
election messages on Twitter and other social media sites. If a 17-year-old Å\ an ineligible voter Å\ does
the same thing, they run the risk of violating election laws. The Education Ministry plans to explain
igSuch dangers by compiling a list of concrete examples and using illustrations.
For the time being, the education of 18-year-old voters could end up having an emphasis on preventing
election violations. (June 19, 2015 "The Japan News")

mm Japan continues to draw record numbers of foreign visitors. In April, the number hit 1.76 million,
setting new record highs for three months ^in a row. The number of Chinese tourists visiting the
country during the popular cherry blossom season more than doubled compared to a year earlier. The
number of inbound tourists in the first four months of the year surged 43 percent from the same period
of 2014. If the trend continues for the rest of the year, the annual total could reach close to 20 million.
It would not be surprising if the government's goal of welcoming 20 million annual inbound tourists is
achieved well ahead of the target year of 2020, when Tokyo hosts the Summer Olympics. The Abe
administration has set a new goal of ^boosting consumption by inbound tourists from Å_2 trillion last
year to Å_4 trillion by 2020. It hopes to develop inbound tourism into a new engine of the economy that
will generate 400,000 new jobs.
The government should identify what policy steps still need to be taken to make Japan an attractive
destination and should steadily implement the measures so that the inbound tourism boom will become
a long-term trend rather than a temporary phenomenon Bat the mercy of economic and other factors.
With the economy still mired in sluggish growth, the retail industry has come to rely greatly on robust
demand by tourists from other parts of Asia, especially visitors from China, who buy so much that their
shopping sprees have been labeled "explosive." Their total consumption in the January-March quarter
Esurged 64 percent from a year before.
The government has introduced ^measures to promote inbound tourism and consumption, such as
easing visa requirements and expanding the scope of goods that are exempt from the consumption tax.
But the primary reason for the boom is the continuing economic growth in many other Asian economies,
which boosted the income levels of people in those countries and their appetite for overseas travel, and
the yen's fall against other currencies, which made visits to Japan more affordable.
International tourism can be affected by various factors, ranging from economic conditions to tensions
in relations between countries, infectious diseases and natural disasters. Inbound tourism to Japan
^plunged sharply when the nation was hit by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima
nuclear crisis in 2011, and the number of Chinese visitors has risen and fallen Bin accordance with the
state of bilateral ties, which have been repeatedly strained over a series of issues.
To help maintain the upward trend, further government and private-sector efforts are needed to make
Japan more attractive as a travel destination. Such efforts can start with ensuring there is enough staffing
at customs and immigration checkpoints at airports to ^keep pace with the rise in the number of visitors.
The inbound tourism boom has pushed up room occupancy rates at many hotels, with figures topping
80 percent in Tokyo and Osaka last year Å\ in some cases resulting in room shortages. One solution
would be to diversify the destinations of foreign tourists, which still tend to be concentrated in Tokyo,
Osaka and other well-established tourist areas. Earlier this month, the government identified seven areas
across Japan as alternative routes for inbound tourists, and plans to ^subsidize public-relations
campaigns and other efforts by local organizations.
While attention tends to focus on the surge in the number of foreign visitors and their spending, their
total consumption is still a Bfraction of the demand by domestic tourists, who spent Å_18.8 trillion in
2014, down by Å_1.4 trillion from the previous year. Efforts to revitalize domestic travel demand Å\
which is forecast to be on a downward trend with the nation's low birthrate and graying population Å\
should also be made to sustain the travel industry. Such an effort can contribute to enhancing Japan's
attraction for all tourists.

Andrea: I've often tried to do that but have never been that successful at it, to tell you the truth.
What I have personally found that really relaxes me though is doing some nighttime reading
before I ( 26 ) off. I keep a great "to read" pile right beside my bed on my nightstand.
Erica: Yes, I too have found that really works. My only problem has been that if I pick something
too exciting, such as a good mystery novel, I can't put it down. I end up getting so ( 27 ) in
it, that I never get to sleep.
Andrea: Totally know what you mean. Can't tell you how often I didn't end up putting the light out
until way after 1:00 AM. I would then sleep through the alarm, so have started to think I
have to try something new.
Erica: I have found that getting ready for the next day also helps. If I prepare everything the night
before, like what I'm going to wear and packing my bag, it gives me one less thing to worry
about and puts my mind to rest. I'm also not ( 28 ) around in the morning.
Andrea: I too try to be quite good about that. Definitely makes for a much less ( 29 ) morning. I also
have found recently that a good stretch before bed helps.
Erica: My mother swore by that. She always used to say that stretching was not only good for her
joints and ( 30 ), but that it also helped her with her sleep. She stretched for about 30
minutes a night religiously. She never became arthritic like her mother either.
Andrea: My mother's habit was to try to go to bed 15 minutes earlier every night than she had
originally planned to. She was always going on about how we all just weren't getting enough
sleep, and how sleep ( 31 ) could have serious effects on our health and productivity the
next day.
Erica: Not a bad idea. If only it were that easy. Heard meditating was quite effective too. It's
supposed to help decrease stress levels and give you ( 32 ) of mind.
Andrea: Yes, the benefits of meditating seem endless; apparently better memory, more creativity and
less anxiety.

Student: Is it possible to just drop in on the day without making a booking?

discussion sessions are only held once or twice a day, though.

language in the Discussion Room.

Bfl There is inequality in any society. Even in the simplest hunter-gatherer band, some people are
bigger, stronger, or smarter than others. Further, some people have more power than others: they are
more able to determine the behavior of others than vice versa. Some people acquire more wealth than
others. Some people are given more status and respect than others.
Physical and intellectual capacities, power, wealth, and status may or may not (1. R grip, c go,
c have, c become) together. Successful athletes, artists, and scientists usually enjoy status, but only
in some societies do they enjoy wealth as well, and rarely do they have political power. Politicians in
some countries can enjoy status and power without wealth; businesspeople can have wealth and power
without status. Such inconsistencies among the various areas of inequality are often felt to be problematic.
In some societies people try to (2. c resolve, c repeat, c regain, c research) them by making
the areas more consistent. Athletes turn professional to become wealthy; politicians exploit their power
and / or move onto attractive business positions in order to do the same; successful businesspeople enter
public office in order to acquire status. This (3. c wealth, c trend, c equality, c status) obviously
increases the overall inequalities in these societies.
In other societies the dominant feeling is that it is a good thing, rather than a problem, if a person's
rank in one area does not match his or her rank in another. A high rank in one area should partly be
*offset by a low rank in another. This process increases the size of the middle class in-between those
who are on top in all (4. c societies, c people, c laws, c respects) and those who lack any kind
of opportunity. The laws in many countries have been conceived to serve this ideal of equality by
treating everybody as equal, but there are (5. c few, c a few, c many, c entire) societies in
which reality matches the ideal.

Ui (A) Around the world, food waste is increasingly seen as a serious environmental and economic
issue. With many families on tight budgets and the global population growing every year, there is
increasing awareness of the resources used carelessly to produce food that is never eaten.
The United Nations estimates that a third of all the food produced in the world is never consumed,
resulting in a total of about 1.3 billion tons of waste a year. In the United States alone, about 40
percent of all food, worth an estimated $165 billion, is wasted, according to a 2012 report.
It is estimated that the food discarded in the developed world by retailers and consumers alone
would be more than enough to feed the world's 870 million hungry people.
The main idea of this passage is that we should
c be able to produce more food for an increasing population.
c not waste produced food.
c visit the United States in order to see how food is wasted.
c tell retailers and consumers in the developed world to feed the world's hungry people.
(B) In Britain, which has some of the most comprehensive data on food waste available, each family
discards, on average, $1,170 worth of food a year.
The environmental consequences of waste are enormous with vast quantities of water, fertilizer and
land used to produce food that is never eaten, and with fuel burned to process, refrigerate, and
transport it.
In developing nations, food waste often happens soon after harvesting, when crops are being stored
or transported, because a shortage of refrigeration and good roads makes it difficult to get food to
market before it spoils. In wealthier countries, waste often begins with retailers rejecting items that
they think will not appeal to customers. But the single biggest force of waste is in homes, where about
half of all uneaten food is estimated to be discarded.
The Food and Agriculture Organization has sought to draw attention to the issue with its campaign,
which urges shoppers to plan before shopping and to freeze more food. The campaign advises that
people should also trust their eyes and noses rather than relying on sell-by dates to decide whether
food is spoiled. The organization is working with supermarket chains to reduce waste by clarifying
expiration dates and selling smaller portions.
According to the passage, which statement is true?
c In Britain, $1,170 worth of food a year is available.

Food waste has little to do with the environment.
Freezing more food decreases the amount of food discarded.
The Food and Agriculture Organization advises people to rely on sell-by dates in order to live a
healthy life.
(C) Such efforts have helped Britain cut food waste by 21 percent since 2007. It is said to be the only
country in Europe to have achieved such a reduction,
Tesco, the first British supermarket chain to publish its waste figures, reported that 28,500 tons of
food went to waste in its stores and distribution centers in the first half of 2013 Å\ 0.87 percent of its
sales volume. That is only a small fraction of total waste in the country, however. The most frequently
wasted items are fresh produce and baked goods, according to a spokesman for Tesco. He said that
bags of lettuce top the list with 68 percent of total production discarded.
The supermarket chain is looking at such "waste hot spots" and has introduced lettuce in bags with
two compartments, so that consumers can use one half while the other stays fresh, the spokesman
said. Tesco is improving some supply processes so that grapes, for example, arrive in stores five to ten
days sooner, giving consumers more time to eat them, he said.
According to the passage, which statement is true?
c Tesco succeeded in reducing food waste by 21 percent in 2007 compared with the previous year.
(D Lettuce accounts for 68 percent of the profits that Tesco generates.
(D The new lettuce bags helps consumers keep the vegetable fresh for a longer time.
c Tesco supplies grapes five to ten days earlier so that consumers can eat them at the beginning of
the season.
(D) In South Korea, a major effort to reduce food waste has come at the government level. In the hope
of reducing food waste by 20 percent, the country has introduced a system that charges for garbage
disposal by weight.
Chinese leaders issued a memo urging officials to scale back on lavish banquets, instructing
government-run cafeterias to serve smaller portions and asking restaurants to make it easier to order
less, the Chinese official news agency reported. The government is also drafting a law on food waste,
the agency reported.
In the United States, the state of Massachusetts is requiring any institution that throws out more
than a ton of food waste each week to *compost it instead.
In Greece, the economic crisis has also driven a new focus on waste. One group in the country
started an online hub to help small shops with excess food connect with people in need nearby.
*compost: allow food to decay so that it can be added to soil to help plants grow
According to the passage, which idea is implied?
c The Chinese government is drafting a law that requires government-run cafeterias to compost
food waste.
(D In Greece, poor people will be able to get access to computers.
(D In Massachusetts, people are required to compost all their food waste without throwing it out.
c In South Korea, the more people reduce their garbage, the less money they have to pay.
(E) One of the greatest challenges today is that food is closely linked to culture and thus touches on
emotional issues that can be difficult to change. "Working on food waste is very ( )," a United
Nations official said. "The idea is not to be *intrusive and tell people what to do." the official said.
"It's probably only necessary to explain to them that they are wasting more food than they think."

People visit other countries for many reasons. Some travel on business, while others travel to take
a break from life's routines and stress. Others travel to visit famous places. Still others go abroad to
deepen their understanding of another culture. But regardless of ,,,the purpose of your trip, there are
eÅ‚Å} 2017 Å}a*^AHF=1i!IE8f c

certain things you should always do when you travel abroad.
Being properly prepared should be your first step. Make sure ^you have the right paperwork. Having
the wrong visa or a passport that is about to expire can cause real problems. Also, make sure you have
good medical insurance, so that if you are sick or injured during your travels you will be able to get
treatment. If you take medication with you, keep it in its original container. If you travel with
prescription drugs, bring a letter from your doctor. If you don't, you might have problems with customs
officials at your destination. Finally, if you want to rent a car, make sure you have an international
driver's license and understand the local traffic laws.
The second thing you should do is to consider steps for your safety. While most people that you meet
are sure to be friendly, there are dangers Å\ theft being the most (3)common. Just as in your home
country, do not expect everyone you meet to be honest. Always keep your valuables out of sight, or in
the hotel safe. Another safety tip when abroad is to do daily errands or go sightseeing with at least one
other person. Two people are much safer than ( 4 ). If there is no one to go sightseeing with, at least
tell someone (hotel staff or other travelers) where you are going that day, and when you expect to return.
When you get to your destination, use only officially-approved buses and taxis. Never accept rides,
from strangers who offer you a lift. If there is no meter in the taxi, agree on a ( 5 ) before you get in.
And always be aware of where the bus or taxi is going. Visitors often make mistakes when using public
transportation in a foreign country. These mistakes can lead to big problems if you do not realize them
soon enough.
Finally, be ready to communicate with local people. Learn some basic words in the local language, and
learn how to say common expressions and ask basic questions. Most importantly, remember to smile! It
is ,cthe friendliest form of communication and is understood in every part of the world!
Following these basic steps will not guarantee a perfect trip. But it will greatly reduce the chances of
problems, and allow you to enjoy your travels Å\ wherever you go, and for whatever reason. Bon voyage!

E9 Stephen Hawking, one of the world's most important scientists, believes that to survive, humans
must move into space: "Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future
should be safe," he says.
Today, the European Union, India, China, Russia, and Japan are all planning to send astronauts back
R eXtt2017ÅíH*^AKPpiffiIE8l

to Earth's closest neighbor: the moon. I 12 I there between 2020 and 2030. These stations will
prepare humans to visit and later live on Mars or other Earth-like planets.
Robert Zubrin, a rocket scientist, also thinks humans should colonize space. He wants to start with
Mars. Why? He thinks sending people to Mars will allow us to learn a lot Å\ for example, I 13 I in
a very different environment. Then we can eventually create new human societies on other planets. In
addition, any advances we make in the fields of science, technology, medicine, and health will also
benefit us here on Earth.
SpaceX is a company that builds rockets. Its owner, Elon Musk, also believes we should colonize Mars,
but he doesn't want just one small colony. He doesn't want to send just "one little mission;" I 14 I .
Not everyone thinks sending humans into space is a smart idea. Many say it's too expensive, even if
it's just a short journey. And most space trips are not short. A one-way trip to Mars, for example,
would take about six months. People traveling this kind of distance face many health problems. Also,
these first people would find life extremely difficult out in space. On the moon's surface, for example,
the sun's rays are very dangerous. I 15. 1 most of the time.
Despite these concerns, sending people into space seems certain. In the future, we might see lunar
cities or even new human cultures on other planets. First stop: the moon.

According to Stephen Hawking, what should we do to make our existence safe in the future?
We should establish independent colonies out in the cosmos.
We should make many lunar cities as soon as possible.
We should start by sending people beyond our solar system.
We should create as many colonies as we like on Mars.
Which of the following would be most likely to happen?
We would return to the moon.
We would make space stations on Mars to prepare for exploration beyond.
We would live on another planet outside the cosmos.
We would make a short journey to Earth.
What do many people say about visiting another planet?
Sending humans into space is very clever.
It is cheap if it's just a short journey.
They could find many strange creatures on other planets.
It is too costly.

H] Perhaps no single monument in the USA is as famous as the Statue of Liberty. Standing on a
small island in New York Harbor, the crowned lady, holding aloft in her right hand the torch of freedom
and in her left hand a tablet inscribed "July 4th, 1776," is a symbol of American democracy. She is
colossal. She is 151 ft. high and the pedestal on which she stands is almost as tall. An elevator takes
visitors to the top of the pedestal, around which a balcony runs. A spiral staircase goes up to the crown,
and another to the torch. The Statue of Liberty was a gift to the USA from France in 1886, as a mark
of friendship and also in memory of the aid France gave the Americans during the American Revolution.
[2] For millions of immigrants*, the Statue was their first sight of the ^promised land, and for a few it
was also the last, as they sailed back home again to a future without hope. About a mile from Liberty
Island, there is another small island, called Ellis Island, which was looked upon with great fear by
immigrants. For it was here that they had to wait their turn to be examined by doctors and officials.
Most of the immigrants could not speak a word of English. But only two out of 100 immigrants were
refused admission to New York City. Often the person refused turned out to be a grandmother or a
weary, frightened girl mistakenly labeled "feeble-minded*." Sometimes husbands and wives were
parted because one of them happened to have a bad cough and was suspected of having tuberculosis*.
02 New York City was a bitter disappointment to some immigrants. Far from being a city paved* with
gold, it was a city with overcrowded, unhealthy, and unsafe ghettos*. The immigrants looked for
earlier immigrants of their own nationality or religion. So Italian, Polish, Irish, Jewish neighborhoods
grew up. Because they could not speak English, the newcomers found it difficult to get work at once,
and their living quarters* were often slums.
|4] However, they found in the USA opportunities of bettering themselves and of escaping from the
cruel rule which many of them had suffered in their own countries. ,mTo that extent, the Statue of
them an honest welcome.
E Today's immigrants no longer have to endure ;r,the indignities of Ellis Island. The grim buildings
were closed down in 1924. In 1976, Ellis Island became a historic monument.

With the growth of the Internet, tourism, and the global economy, it feels like the world is getting
smaller. Ideas, products, and customs are flying from country to country in the blink of an eye. As
these cultural exports grow, the world is slowly but I 34 I becoming a global village.
Entertainment is one of the most popular cultural exports. Every year, movies from Hollywood are
watched by billions of people worldwide. I 35 I. TV shows and music are making their way from
America to Asia. As people enjoy these entertainment products, they also learn about the ideas and
values of other cultures.

Fashion is another big cultural export. In the past, it took months for trends to I 36 I to other
countries. Now, with the Internet, a new style from Paris can become famous overnight. Plus, today's
super-fast shipping means that a shop in South Africa can receive European goods in I 37 I.
Some people are unhappy about the rapid spread of foreign cultures. They worry it will harm their
local 1 38 I. For sure, young people are often interested in new ideas and products from abroad. Yet
the more we learn about each other, the closer we become. That helps export our most important
cultural products: greater understanding and world peace.

SSJ In 2010, Uniqlo formed a joint venture with Grameen Healthcare Trust in Bangladesh. The
purpose of Grameen Uniqlo is to sell clothes made by locals, for locals, at affordable prices for people
living near the poverty line, and to nurture local retailing expertise. But as the local retail staff diligently
counted their door-to-door sales of T-shirts, priced at $1 or $2, from village to village, the company that
owns Uniqlo, Fast Retailing Co., realized it had come accross a wealth of untapped data on a rapidly
growing economy.
"We learned which communities wanted bright reds and greens, which preferred muted tones," Fast
Retailing Senior Vice President Yukihiro Nitta said in an interview. "We learned to stock more men's
wear, because women who wear saris buy mostly leggings and home wear."
When the venture opened its first stores in Dhaka in July, Mr. Nitta discovered that in a shop full of $2
and $3 items, shoppers will spend $10 for a pair of jeans or $9 for a shirt with a collar that can be used
on more formal occasions. The stores now stock 70% to 75% of a store's floor space with items for men.

KB If we truly want to achieve world peace, we have to get rid of weapons of war. And the world is
full of weapons Å\ guns, rockets, tanks, landmines. What are landmines? Landmines are special bombs
which are buried in the ground. They're designed to explode when a person steps on them. Landmines
are one of the cruelest weapons of war. Why? Because they don't discriminate between soldiers and
civilians. Their casualties include men and women, adults and children, young and old. Even after wars
end, mthey can remain for days, months and years waiting for innocent victims.
Do you know any landmine victims? I do. My brother-in-law is a landmine survivor. He's an
American journalist. Back in the 1960s, he was sent to Asia to report on the Vietnam War. One day, he
was walking with a group of American soldiers through the jungle. The soldiers were carrying rifles. He
was carrying his camera and notebook. As he was walking, he suddenly stepped on a landmine buried
in the ground. Instantly, the landmine exploded, sending pieces of metal up into his body. Normally, he
would have died instantly. But, somehow he survived the explosion. The soldiers quickly called for an
army helicopter. The helicopter took him to a nearby military hospital. After an emergency
^operation, he was taken to Saigon for further medical care. Eventually, he was flown back to New
York where he spent one year in hospital. Thanks to his doctors, he slowly recovered. But even now, 50
years later, he still suffers terrible pain from his injuries. To manage this pain, he swims an hour each
day in a swimming pool. He's lucky to be alive!
Hundreds of people around the world have worked to eliminate landmines. Famous celebrities
connected to ,,,this movement include Princess Diana of England and pop singer Paul McCartney.

Hot Defensive Bee Ball
In nature, animals threatened by enemies display various kinds of adaptive behaviors to escape or
actively defend themselves against the enemies. Honeybees commonly use their stingers* to
counterattack an intruder. Japanese honeybees, ((D), fight against the giant hornet,* their most
horrible natural enemy, by displaying a characteristic behavior called "hot defensive bee ball
5 formation."* In fall, giant hornets attack Japanese honeybee colonies. If a hornet tries to enter the
beehive, a group of more than 500 worker bees quickly swarm around the hornet, trapping it inside
the bee ball. In the ball formation, honeybees vibrate their flight muscles to produce heat. The
temperature in the ball quickly rises to almost 47Åã C, which is deadly to the hornet. The high
temperature phase continues for approximately 20 minutes. Within 30 to 60 minutes after the
10 formation of the bee ball, the hornet is killed by the heat produced.
( (D ), European honeybees, which are a related species and were introduced to Japan in the Meiji
era (about 140 years ago), exhibit only stinging behavior against hornets. The outer skin of the
giant hornet, however, is too thick for a bee to sting, and colonies of European honeybees are often
completely destroyed. While this discovery may seem to demonstrate that the Japanese honeybee is
15 "smarter" than its European counterpart, this is not the case. There are no giant hornets in Europe.
They inhabit Asia, including Japan. So, it's merely an evolutionary consequence of adaptation to the
threat of natural enemies.
( (D ) this "hot defensive bee ball" behavior has been known for some time, the mechanism
behind it has been hidden in a veil of mystery. But researchers at Japan's University of Tokyo,
20 through study of the bees' brains, have detected a previously undiscovered kind of neural* activity
that takes place when the bees engage in "hot defensive bee balling." The researchers were
astonished by the fact that the collective heat generated by the group, while fatal for the hornet,
leaves the bees unaffected. Even more surprisingly, they used perfectly coordinated teamwork
during the process. When an outsider enters, the honeybees are immediately on their guard. Then
25 all at once, they gather to attack. So, it's not that one commands all the rest. They are acting
collectively in an emergency. Curious about why the bees attack this way, the researchers examined
their brains and found that neural activity in bees involved with the "hot defensive bee ball"
increased. It's a kind of neural activity that isn't seen in European honeybees, taking place in the
higher brain center.*

When people talk about university today you often hear the phrase "return on investment." In
other words, how much money you will get out of doing it, mrelative to the amount that you have put in.
What no one seems to ask is what the "return" that university is supposed to give you is. Is it just about
earning more money? Is the only purpose of an education to enable you to get a job? What, we need to
ask ourselves, is university for?
There has been ,,a lot of debate recently in the United States about higher education, especially about
increasing school fees, rising student debt, and the tough labor market for new graduates. We talk about
the future of the university: budget cuts, distance learning, online courses, and whether the university in
its present form is even necessary. We talk about national competitiveness, the twenty-first-century
labor force, technology and engineering, and the prospects for our future prosperity. But we never talk
about the principles that underlie this conversation, as if what makes for a happy life or a good society
were perfectly obvious, and as if n)in either case the one and only answer were more money.
Of course money matters: jobs matter, financial security matters, national prosperity matters. The
question is, are they the only things that matter? Life is more than a job; a job is more than a salary; and
a nation is more than its ( X ). Education is more than the obtaining of marketable* skills, and you are
PEZtt 2017 ÅíD*^AHFp1HIER •
S*R*(X)
-50-
more than your ability to contribute to your employer's profitability or the nation's GDP*, no matter
what politicians and business executives would like you to think. To ask what university is for is to ask
what life is for, what society is for: ( Y ), what people are for.
Do students ever hear this? What they hear is a constant drumbeat that seeks to march them in the
opposite direction. When policy makers talk about higher education, from the president all the way
down, they talk exclusively in terms of math and science. Journalists and commentators Å\ some of
whom majored in humanities* and none of whom are nurses or engineers Å\ never tire of lecturing the
young about the foolishness of wanting to learn things just because you're curious about them. "Top Ten
Majors" means the most employable, not the most interesting. "Top Ten Fields of Study" means above-
average income, not job satisfaction. "What are you going to do with (4)that?" someone will inevitably
ask when they hear that a young person is thinking of applying to study for a humanities degree.
I'm not sure what the "practical" people are so concerned about. MAfter all, not many of our students
are demanding to get into classes on Shakespeare and Socrates. English literature is now, alas, the
choice of only 3 percent of students. Business, at 21 percent, accounts for more than one and a half
times as many undergraduates as all of the arts and humanities combined. In 1972, 73 percent of
freshmen at American universities said that it was essential or very important to "develop a meaningful
philosophy of life," 37 percent to be "very wealthy": ,clnot just wealthy, but very wealthy. By 2012, the
numbers were almost reversed, 47 percent and 80 percent, respectively. For years we've been loudly
announcing that happiness is money (or even better, money and fame). No wonder students have come
to believe that university is all about getting a job.
Of course you need to get a job, but you also need to get a life. What's the return on investment of
university? What's the return on investment of having children, spending time with friends, reading a
book, doing volunteer work, traveling?
that are most worth
own sake. Anyone who tells you that the only purpose
are
is the obtaining of marketable skills
is attempting to reduce you to a productive employee at work, a passive consumer in the market, and an
obedient citizen of the nation. When we ask ourselves what university is for, we must remember that the
question is really about our ability to remain fully human.

WM What is language for? It fulfils two main functions: it tells us about things, and it allows us to
interact, in various ways, with other members of our species Å\ from encounters in shops and banks, to
chatting with friends, family and lovers. And in ,,.so doing, we attempt to influence the actions, thoughts
and feelings of others. Both functions allow us to communicate with one another.
( X ) of communication, language has much in common with many others that abound in nature.
The distinctive colouring of some species provides a signal that is interpreted by potential predators* as a
warning of danger. An example is the yellow and black stripes of wasps*.
Of course, we wouldn't normally consider the message signalled by body colour to be language-like.
Communication systems are usually thought to involve some level of ,,,intentionality Å\ the signaller, to
some degree, is consciously conveying a message, in a specific context, for some particular purpose.
Moreover, communication systems found in the wild can be more or less complex, more or less
individually learned, and more or less flexibly applied to a range of contexts. Some of the most
significant complexity associated with non-human communication system involves birdsong, and the
songs of whales. The greatest flexibility is associated with the naturally occurring gestures of apes, such
as chimpanzees, which also appear to be individually learned.
To gain a sense of the sorts of communication systems that abound in the wild, consider the honeybee.
Honeybees live in large colonies consisting of a queen bee, male bees and worker bees, which are the
offspring of the queen and male bees. In a famous study, Karl von Frisch, the Austrian biologist and
Nobel Prize winner, was the first to figure out the significance of the dance of the honeybees. We now
know with certainty that honeybees, as well as other species, are capable of communicating
about the location of food. Once a worker has located a source of nectar*, it returns to
can refer to
from declaring
the hive* in
to signal the location to the other bees. This is achieved via a sophisticated dance
performed on a wall inside the hive. The dance indicates the distance of the food source from the hive,
as well as its direction.
While bees communicate through dance, other species rely on voice. A striking example is the alarm
calls made by vervet monkeys*, which live in southern and eastern Africa. Vervets make specific and
distinct calls upon sight of different predators: the sound they make when they see a snake is different
from the (4)ones they make when they spot an eagle or leopard.
Clearly, while communicative systems such as K, these are interesting, they are highly restricted in
terms of their communicative value. In the case of both bees and vervet monkeys the symbolic systems
used are limited to specific contexts of use. This is not, of course, to reduce the importance of those
contexts, and the value of the communicative systems for the well-being and survival of the species. But
eternal
guage is much more flexible in the variety of situations tha
to negotiating a peace treaty to commenting on the weather.
And, it is flexible in another way too Å\ different communities of humans adopt different linguistic
varieties: Swahili, Japanese and English are all quite distinct, in a range of ways. This is because the
system itself is naturally flexible. Its flexibility arises from a process that allows us to combine otherwise
meaningless symbols. Sounds and words can be combined variously, following the 'rules' of an abstract
grammar, individually learned, that humans carry around with them in their heads. It is perhaps this
capability that [,,,(Å‚) the communication systems / (b) from / (c) human language / (d) most distinguishes]

As a communication system, the dance of the honeybee is as complicated as human language.
Close similarities are found between human language and the vervet monkey's alarm calls.
Essentially, human language is no different from many non-human communication systems.
Human language is more flexible than other communication systems in at least two respects.
The only purposes of both animal communication and human language are well-being and
survival.

places that you never knew existed. Think of the moon,
for example. Human beings have always known it was there, but astronauts didn't explore it until 1969.
For medieval Europeans, much of Asia and the Far East might as well have been the moon. They had
heard of countries called Persia and China, but they knew next to ( 1 ) about them.
So, it is surprising to discover that China and Europe had been trading since Roman times. The key to
it all was silk. This beautiful material is woven from thread produced by silkworms. Chinese silk was

Wealthy Europeans had always loved to dress in silk. Every year great amounts of it were transported
overland and sold for huge amounts of money. Back in the other direction, west ( 3 ) east, went goods
such as horses, wool, silver, and gold. Over the centuries, a network of tracks spread across Asia.
Together, they came to be known as the Silk Road.
( 4 ) the goods traveled thousands of miles, few of the merchants did. Instead, a trader would buy
something of value, transport it part of the way, then, sell it to another trader, who would do the same.
This was partly for ( 5 ) Å\ the distance between the Chinese capital (today's Beijing) and the great

When Tim started a new job as a manager, one of his top priorities was communicating to his
office team that he valued each member's contribution. So at team meetings, as each member spoke up
about whatever project they were working ( X ), Tim made sure he put on his "active-listening face" to
signal that he cared about what each person was saying.
But after meeting with him a few times, Tim's team got a very different message from mthe one he
intended to send. After a few weeks of meetings, one team member was finally brave enough to ask
him the question that had been on everyone's mind. That question was: "Tim, are you angry with us right
now?" When Tim explained that he wasn't at all angry Å\ that he was just putting on his "active-listening
face"Å\ his colleague gently explained that his active-listening face looked a lot like his angry face.
According to Heidi Grant Halvorson, a social psychologist at Columbia Business School who has
extensively researched how people perceive* one another, Tim's story captures one of the primary
problems of being a human being: although you might wish to ( Y ) in a certain way to others, people
often perceive you in an altogether different way.
One person may think, for example, that by offering help to a colleague, others will see her as
generous. But
misunderstands
her offer as a lack of trust in his abilities. Just as he
she misunderstands him: she offered him help because she thought he was
overworked and stressed. He has, after all, been showing up early to work and going home late every
day. But that's not why he's,,,keeping strange hours; he just works best when the office is less crowded.
These kinds of misunderstandings lead to conflict and resentment not just at work, but at home too.
How many fights between couples have started with one person not understanding what another says
and does? He stares at his plate at dinner while she's telling a story and she ( Zi ) he doesn't care
about what she's saying, when really he is admiring the beautiful meal she made. She goes to bed early
rather than watching their favorite television show together like they usually do, and he ( Z2 ) she's not
interested in spending time with him, when really she's just exhausted after a tough day at work.
Most of the time, Halvorson says, people don't realize they are not seen by others the way they think
they are. "If I ask you," Halvorson told me, "about how you see yourself Å\ what traits* you would say
describe you Å\ and I ask someone who knows you well to list your traits, there will not be much
correlation* between what you say and what your friend says. There's a big gap between how other
people see us and how we see ourselves."
mThis gap arises, Halvorson explains, from some quirks* of human psychology. First, most people
suffer from what psychologists call ",c,the transparency illusion" Å\ the belief that what they feel, desire,
and intend is very clear to others, even though they have done very little to communicate clearly what is
going on inside their minds. Because people presume they are transparent, they might not spend the
time or effort to be as clear about their intentions or emotional states as they could be, giving people
around them very little information with which to make an accurate judgment.
"It's quite possible," Halvorson writes, "that how you look when you are slightly frustrated isn't all
that different from how you look when you are a little concerned, confused, disappointed, or nervous.
Your 'I'm kind of hurt by what you just said' face probably looks a lot like your 'I'm not at all hurt by
what you just said' face. And the majority of times that you've said to yourself, 'I made my intentions
clear,' or 'He knows what I meant,' you didn't, and mhe doesn't."

I want you to travel with me to a famine camp* in Sudan on the Ethiopian border. You may have seen
the dreadful television reports of the starving babies, their bellies swollen. Flies crawl in and out of their
eyes and mouths, trying to suck the last drops of moisture that cling there as long as these babies cling to
life. Now you are among them, as a reporter for a daily newspaper, required to write about a place you
have never been before, about an event you can't possibly understand, for readers who will never go
there and,,,don't know what it has to do with them Å\ beyond giving money to charity.
You've been at the camp for several days. You walk its ground each day, stepping around and over
,,,100,000 people who have come because they heard there was water. ( X ) the time they arrived Å\
some of them walking three weeks from their Ethiopian villages Å\ the water was no more than a well of
mud in a dry riverbed.
You watch the little girls walk to the river and dig in the mud, soaking their old torn clothes with
moisture that they wring*, drop by drop, into their plastic cups. You sit in the clinic where the waiting
line is hundreds of people long. Desperate fathers push their babies at you, thinking that because you
are a khawaja, a foreigner, you must be a doctor. You must be able to help. But all you have to offer is
a notebook and some questionsÅ\,,,suddenly too little to capture this reality.
At night you retreat to the other side of the straw wall that encloses this awful world. You collapseÅ\
( Y ) of your temporary hunger, of your selfish fears Å\ on a bed in a small straw hut*. You're grateful
that it's dark, that you will not have to look at things for a few hours, but you can still hear. You hear
coughing and crying. You hear shouts, angry bursts of life, and the final sounds people make as they die.
Then you hear something else: singing. You hear sweet chants and deep rhythms. Each night, over
and over, at about the same time. You think you are dreaming. You wonder if you have gone quite mad
from your fear. How could people sing in the face of this horror? And why? You lie in the dark and
you wonder until you fall asleep. Daylight comes again, and you open your eyes.
I went to Africa in 1985 to report on the Ethiopian famine for a newspaper. I had never been outside

1 Mothers nowadays may feel like they're too busy to sit down, and ,,many probably are, but a
recent report suggests that on average they are far more sedentary Å\ in other words, spend more time
seated Å\ than moms were 50 years ago.
Since 1965, women with children have spent increasingly more time watching television and driving,
and increasingly less time playing with children, doing chores*, and exercising, according to the report.
In 1965, mothers of children aged 5 to 18 spent 14.2 more hours a week being physically active than
being sedentary. In 2010, they spent 3.8 more hours a week being sedentary than they did on physical
activity.
The authors of the report used data from a representative sample of American people over the past
fifty years. For the purposes of the report, physical activity" was defined as time spent cooking and
cleaning, along with playing with children and exercising. Sedentary activity was everything else non-
work-related, such as time spent watching television, surfing the Internet, as well as time spent driving.
They found that
per week less in 2010
with older children
were physically active for about 11 hours
in 1965. Among moms with children younger than 5, the decline was nearly
14 hours a week. Today, in 2010, the two groups are physically active for 20.9 and 29.7 hours each
week, respectively.
Though we might think unemployed mothers have more time for exercise, physical activity has
decreased more among mothers who don't work than among those who have full-time jobs. However,
nowadays, moms who don't work still spend more total time being physically active than those who
(4)do. Mothers with older children have also increased their sedentary time by 7 hours a week since
1965. The increase was 5.7 hours a week for mothers with younger children. Again, unemployed
mothers saw greater increases in sedentary time. ( X ), mothers today burn between 1,238 and 5,835
calories less each week than mothers did in the 1960s. A kilogram of fat is roughly 9,000 calories.
Of course, much of the decline has to do ( Y ) housework. Dishwashers didn't become a common
part of middle-class homes until the 1970s, and clothes washers and dryers were too expensive for many
until the 1980s. Few women today would likely say that their preferred form of exercise is washing
clothes by hand.
But the other side of the technological-advancement argument is how widespread M screen-based
entertainment is: physical activity time reached a low point in the 1990s, according to the report
authors, just as the Internet became popular and TVs greatly decreased in price.
If mothers set examples for children, they're increasingly modeling a screen- and car-based existence,
which will probably not be good for either their own or their kids' health. Not only does a pregnant
woman's body mass index* affect the health of her fetus*, the report authors say ,c,kids raised by
sedentary parents are less likely to have healthy habits themselves. "Evidence suggests that mothers'
behavior may also play a role in determining the risk of obesity* in children," they point out.
It's not clear what the solution is here. According to a study, among couples with children, when both
parents work full-time, women do more housework, childcare, and other household tasks each week,
leaving many feeling like they already come home to a "second job." Many unemployed mothers, on
the other hand, likely don't have the resources to join exercise classes, or even to pay for an hour of
babysitting so they can jog around the block. There was very little good about the days when women
essentially stayed at home, and were unpaid manual laborers, but ( Z ) that lifestyle might have been
better for their physical fitness.

E9 One day, John popped into a convenience store to buy a cup of coffee. He poured his coffee and
took the cup to the table that had the cup covers, sugar, and other coffee-related things. The coffee cup
was very hot, so the first thing on his ( X ) was getting a cardboard* holder to place it in. His hand was
starting to feel uncomfortable from the heat, but he had to wait because the store was crowded and three
people were blocking his path to the cup holders. They were a mother with her two children, a young
girl and a slightly older boy.
The mother had a hot cup of coffee in her right hand and urgently wanted to slip it into a holder. Her
left hand was carrying a couple of things she wanted to purchase, so she asked the boy to take a holder
from the rack, mwhich he did. The holder was pressed flat, and she asked him to open it and hold it on
the table so that she could slip her cup into it.

that he should hold it between his thumb and fingers

He tried to wrap the flattened cardboard around the cup she was holding.
The mother had a ( Y ) expression on her face Å\ one that John probably shared Å\ because her hand
was getting very hot. At this point, the little girl, clearly frustrated by her big brother's inability to see
what could be done with the flattened holder, took it from his hand, pinched it so that it expanded into a
ring, and then placed it on the table for her mother to slip the cup into. Only just in time.

In an experiment, a team of developmental psychologists showed five-year-old, six-year-old, and
seven-year-old children a miniature room that contained a teddy bear, and told the children that the
teddy bear wanted a toy out of reach on a high shelf inside that room. The room also contained a box
and a few other objects that the bear could potentially use to help solve ,.,the problem. Unsurprisingly,
the older children were more likely than the younger children to use the box as a platform for the bear

to stand on and reach the toy. ,filThe few
children who were able to think of this solution
needed more time than the older ones to figure it out.
That's what happened when the box was presented separately from the other objects. For a different
group of kids, (7)it was initially filled with the other objects, reminding them of a box's usual function as
a container. When the box contained something, the younger children were more likely than the older
ones to think of it as a platform for the bear to stand on. They also thought of this solution more
quickly than the older kids. The little ones' relative lack of life experience enabled them to consider the
wider possibilities that were not thought of by the older children.

El It is hard to say who first put fish on the menu. The invention of the grand 'modern' style of
cookery in Europe has usually been traced ( 1 ) to the Sicilians or their neighbors, the people of the
town of Sybaris, a short way across the sea at the tip of Southern Italy. In the year 510 these people
were defeated by the Sicilians and their city destroyed, but stories of their fabulous riches were ( 2 )

the inventor a small sum of money. ( 3 ), he claimed that in Sybaris fishers and fish-sellers did not

Fish also seems to have been very important in the food culture of Sicily. According to one source,
they called the sea itself 'sweet' because they so ( 4 ) the food that came out of it. Sicily also produced
the first cookbooks. Among the earliest was one by a famous chef called Mithaecus. Very few of his
books remain, but the few fragments that we still have today show how central fish was to the diet of his

Sitting at the front of the grade four classroom in her school uniform, Priscilla Sitienei listens
carefully while she writes the English names of animals in her notebook. She joined Leaders Vision
Preparatory School* five years ago and has also served her village in the Rift Valley in Kenya* as a
midwife* for the last sixty-five years. In fact, she has helped deliver some of her own classmates, who
are aged ten to fourteen.
Fondly known as "Gogo", which means grandmother in the local Kalenjin language*, she says that at
age ninety she is finally learning to read and write Å\ an opportunity she never had as a child. More
comfortable speaking in Kalenjin than English, she explains why she wanted to return to school. "I'd
like to be able to read the Bible. I also want to m inspire children to get an education. Too many older
children are not in school. They even have children themselves."
Gogo says she,,, confronts children who are not in school and asks them why. "They tell me they are too
old," she says. "I tell them, 'Well I go to school and so should you.' I see children who are lost, children
who are without fathers, just, a, going round and round, hopeless. I want to inspire them to go to school."
At first, the school officials Mturned her away. However, they soon understood how,,,committed she
was to learning. The head teacher, David Kinyanjui, believes that Gogo, who lives in the village school,
is ,,,an example to the rest of her class. "I'm very proud of her," he says. "Gogo has been a blessing to
this school. She has been a positive influence on all the pupils. She is loved by every pupil, and they all
want to learn and play with her. She is doing well, and I can say I have seen a big difference in this
school since she came."
Sitienei grew up in Kenya when it was occupied by the British, and she lived through her country's
(5)struggle for independence. Now a school leader, she stakes part in all of the classes Å\ math, English,
P.E.*, dance, drama, and singing. Dressed in her blue school uniform and green sweater, she also tells
stories to her classmates to make sure her knowledge of local customs is Mpassed on. The children sit
under trees near the playing fields and listen to every word she says.
An eleven-year-old girl says she is Gogo's best friend because Gogo tells stories to, and goes to P.E.
with, the students. A ten-year-old school boy says the grandmother also likes to mikeep them in order.
"We love Gogo because when we make noise she tells us to keep quiet," he says.
The current record for the oldest elementary school pupil in the Guinness Book of Records* is held by
Å_ another Kenyan, the late Kimani Maruge. He went to school at the age of eighty-four, in 2004, and died
five years later. Sitienei's elementary school says it will write to the record keepers to inform them
about their ninety-year-old student.
"I want to say to the children of the world, especially girls, that education will be your wealth. Don't
look back and run to your father," she says. "With education you can be whatever you want, a doctor, a
lawyer, or a pilot." Gogo's own lesson is that it is never too late.

U fcOZbttU/vt?, MWcgx.fcSv*,,
When Charles Darwin, famous for his scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, visited the
Galapagos Islands* in the 1830s, he made an interesting discovery about the native birds. He noticed
that thirteen ,a,individual species of finches* were similar in many ways, yet the size and shape of their
beaks* were different. Some of the birds had long, thin beaks, whereas others had short, thick ones.
Still others had shapes somewhere in between. As a result, Darwin mfigured that these species had come
from a common ancestor. Put another way, he thought that a single species of bird had eventually
evolved* into the thirteen distinct species that he had observed. But how and why had this happened?
Why did all the birds have beaks of different lengths?
Darwin noticed that each of the species occupied a separate island in the Galapagos chain. On each of
these islands, the finches ate different types of food. On one island, for example, they,,, lived on various
small insects, whereas on another, they ate fruits and nuts. Darwin then made an important connection
between the shape of the finches' beaks and the kind of food they ate. Each beak, he realized, was
suited to each bird's diet. Darwin observed that the finches with long, thin beaks lived in places where
they had to reach between rocks to get insects, while finches with thicker beaks lived on islands where
they used these beaks to inbreak open nuts.
Though Darwin's observations could be considered remarkable in their own right, they are also what
Darwin relied on to help develop his theory of evolution. He realized that the birds had grown beaks
suited to their particular environments because nature had caused these changes over many generations.
Long ago, birds with different types of beaks had probably lived on each island. However, over time, the
population of birds with beaks that were better suited to each island's available food supply had
increased. For example, finches with long, thin beaks did well on islands with many insects, whereas
those with other kinds of beaks on such islands disappeared. Over time, the poorly suited birds had died

such as beak size, become more or less prominent for a species in an environment. "Evolution" refers to
the changes that occur in animal and plant characteristics, and ,n,how those changes lead to further selection.
Darwin's theory is not just for birds, but helps explain the evolution of all plant and animal species,
including humans. In short, an animal with characteristics that are better suited to its environment will

survival, thus increasing its chances for reproducing. This means that members
a species with biological characteristics better suited to their environment can replace others within
their own species, push aside other species, and even evolve into new species. What happens depends
on the ,S|circumstances. The process itself can take just a few generations or many thousands of years,
but the result is something like what Darwin had observed in the Galapagos Islands.

It is becoming more and more difficult for workers to switch off from work. ( 1 ), many workers answer
or write e-mails on the train to and from work, during lunchtime, and at home after work. ( 2 ), many
people even check their work e-mail when they go on vacation to other countries. ( 3 ), this might be
changing. A German car manufacturer is giving its workers the choice not to receive e-mail when they
are on holiday. This will mean employees will be able to relax on the beach ( 4 ) dealing with work
problems. Employees can choose to automatically remove all work e-mail while on vacation.
Their system is called "Mail on Holiday." The sender gets a reply that says: "I'm using "Mail on
Holiday," so your e-mails will be removed. If you want me to read this e-mail personally, please be kind
enough to send me the information again." Not everyone thinks the system is a good idea, ( 5 ).
Some customers may not like receiving a message telling them to
lose business.

U The survival of the human race faces many ( T ). In the short term, the planet we live on is
under threat. If we hope to inhabit Earth for a long time into the future, we must find a way to combat
the immediate problems of global warming and overpopulation. Overcoming these problems will ( -i )
the health of our planet and all the life on it, not just humans. But, even if we manage to do this, life
will eventually no longer be possible here.
It is estimated that the sun, which provides the energy ( ) for life, will last another five billion
years. After that, it will begin to expand, and Earth will become too hot to support life as we know it.
( z. ), if humans want to survive forever, we must find another planet to colonize. Partly with this
reality in mind and partly out of genuine curiosity about the universe, astronomers are searching for
planets outside of our solar system. So far, they have found around 2,000 exoplanets Å\ planets that
orbit stars other than our own sun.
Finding exoplanets is only part of the challenge since obviously not all planets support life. Scientists
have determined that any planet we hope to colonize must be within the so-called habitable zone around
• EXtt 2017 :ÅíllÅ}#AHFp1ffiIEgÅ_
-69-


if
its parent star. The habitable zone is the ( % ) around a star where the temperature is neither too hot
nor too cold.
We are looking for stars that are of similar size to our own sun, and planets that are roughly the same
size as Earth. Astronomers have ( ii ) that there could be 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-
like stars in our own galaxy alone. In July 2015, they found the best potential candidate yet Å\ a planet
named Kepler 452b. What makes Kepler 452b so ( ) is that it is nearly the same size as Earth and
orbits its sun at almost the same distance. In fact, a year on Kepler 452b would be only 20 days longer
than an Earth year.
Of course, there are still many questions we need to answer about Kepler 452b. Is it mostly ( 9 ), like
Earth, or is it mostly gas? What is its atmosphere like? Is there liquid water on its surface? But the biggest
question is, "How can we get there?" Whether or not Kepler 452b is capable of supporting ( ), it is
extremely far away, and we don't have the technology to get to it. Located 1,400 light years from Earth,
it would take our most modern space probes more than 20 million years to reach Kepler 452b.
Fortunately, if we can solve our more immediate problems on Earth, we will have a lot of time to continue
exploring the universe and developing the means to ( ^ ) humans even further into space someday.

M) France is known for the long crusty baguette and has more bread bakers than any other , country in
Europe. Yet, sales of pre-cut bread for toast or sandwiches are rising. Last year, sales of Harry's, the
pleading sliced-bread brand, were up by 25% since 2007. Why have sales increased? Mainly because

it stays 3hot longer. Sliced bread can last for days, whereas a freshly baked baguette is best eaten
within hours of coming out of the 4oven. Many women in France today are too ?busy to pick up a
baguette every day because they work full-time. Also, lunchtime habits are changing. Many French
now take as little as 15 minutes to eat lunch, so sandwich consumption is on the 6rise. Another answer
is Harry's "American" sliced bread without crust is heavily advertised on television to children.
(Å°Å‚ Wireless charging is a recent technology that allows a wide range of , solar powered machines,
including electric cars, to be 2charged without using any cords. This technology has been used in
South Korea since 2013 to power buses for public transportation and will soon be , tested in the
United Kingdom for electric passenger vehicles. What is special about both of these cases is that the
charging ,, technology is embedded in the roads, so electric vehicles can be charged while driving. One
advantage of this method of charging
made smaller, reducing the
charging is that 5 batteries do not need to store as much power and can be
cost of producing electric vehicles. Also, as they are constantly being
charged while in cmotion, the driving range of electric vehicles is potentially limitless.
(j-) In , strength training, exercises are classified as isolation exercises or compound exercises. Isolation
exercises work one specific muscle. Curling a dumbbell, which only works the bicep ,, muscle, is an
example of an isolation exercise. Compound exercises, on the other hand, use several different
muscles at the same time and are the most effective exercises for increasing strength. A good 3gym
will have both isolation and compound exercises. There are 4 three especially effective compound
exercises. First is the bench press, which works many muscles in the chest, arms, and shoulders. Next,
your workout routine shouldinclude squats. Squats use most leg muscles and also exercise muscles in
the lower back. Finally, the most effective compound exercise is the deadlift. Deadlifts work almost
all 6major muscle groups, including legs, upper and lower back, arms, and shoulders.
W Do cats and dogs have blood types just like humans? Yes, they do, though they are categorized
, differently. Cats have A, B, and AB, but they are not the same as humans'. ,Dogs, on the other
hand, are quite different. They have eight major blood types, labeled as DEA (dog erythrocyte
antigen) 1 to 8. Why is it ,important to know what blood type a person or an animal has? It is
because, when a blood 4test is necessary, a different type of blood may cause a serious and sometimes
fatal reaction. However, unlike humans and most animals, dogs don't have naturally-occurring
antibodies against different blood types, and they can receive any 5type of blood if it is their first
transfusion. Once a different type of blood is given, the recipient dog c develops antibodies against the
donated blood type, so this type of blood shouldn't be used for a second transfusion.

You are on your way to a concert. At an intersection, you encounter a group of people, all staring at
the sky. Without even thinking about @it, you look upwards, too. Why? Social proof. In the middle
of the concert, when the soloist is giving an excellent performance, someone begins to clap and
suddenly ?the whole room joins in. You do, too. Why? Social proof. After the concert you go to the
coat check to pick up your coat. You watch how the people in front of you place a coin on a plate,
even though, officially, the service is included in the ticket price. What do you do? You probably leave
a coin as well. Why? Social proof.
Social proof, sometimes roughly termed the herd instinct, dictates that individuals feel they are
behaving correctly when they act the same as other people. In other words, if a large number of
people follow a certain idea, others will find this idea truer or better. And ^the more people who
display a certain behavior, the more appropriate others will judge it. This is, of course, ridiculous.
Social proof is the evil behind economic bubbles and stock market panic. It exists in fashion,
management techniques, hobbies, religion and diets. In some cases, it can even negatively affect whole
cultures.
A simple experiment carried out in the 1950s by legendary psychologist Solomon Asch shows how
common sense is influenced by peer pressure, the tendency to want to act the same as the members of
one's social group. In Asch's experiment, a research participant is shown a line drawn on paper, and
next to it three lines Å\ numbered 1, 2 and 3 Å\ one shorter, one longer and one of the same length as
the original one. The participant must indicate which of the three lines mcorresponds to the original
one. If that participant is alone in the room, he gives correct answers Å\ unsurprising, because the task
is really quite simple. Now five other people enter the room; they are all actors, a fact that the
participant does not know. One after another, they give wrong answers, saying "number 1," although
it's very clear that number 3 is the correct answer. Then it is the participant's turn again. In one third
of cases, ^,he will answer incorrectly to match the other people's responses.
Why do we act like this? In the past, following others was a good survival strategy. Suppose that
50,000 years ago, you were travelling in the wild with your hunter-gatherer friends, and suddenly they
all fled at the sight of an animal. What would you have done? Would you have remained still,
wondering about what you were looking at? Was it a lion, or something that just looked like a lion but
was in fact a harmless animal? No, you would have followed your friends. Later on, when you were
safe, you could have reflected on what the "lion" had actually been. Those who acted differently from
the group ^did not pass their genes on to the later generations. We are directly descended from those
who copied the others' behavior. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today, even
when it offers no survival advantage, which is most of the time. mOnly a few cases come to mind
where social proof is of value. For example, if you find yourself hungry in a foreign city and don't
know a good restaurant, it makes sense to pick the one that's full of local people. In other words, you
copy the local people's behavior.
Comedy and talk shows make use of social proof by inserting sounds of people laughing at key
7 •

-74-
moments, encouraging the audience to laugh along. One of the most impressive, though troubling,
cases of this phenomenon is the famous speech by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels,
delivered to a large audience in 1943. As the war went from bad to worse for Germany, he asked the
crowd: "Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything
that we can even imagine today?" The crowd responded very loudly and enthusiastically, "Yes!" If
the people had been asked individually and anonymously, it is likely that nobody would have
consented to ^this crazy proposal.
The advertising industry benefits greatly from our weakness for social proof. This works well when
^ a situation is unclear Å\ such as deciding among various car makes, cleaning products, beauty products,
etc. with no obvious advantages or disadvantages Å\ and where people "like you and me
appear.
So, don't trust a company's advertisement which claims its product is better because it is "the most
popular." mHow is a product better simply because it sells the most units? And remember novelist
W. Somerset Maugham's wise words: "Even if 50 million people say something foolish, it is still

Ned, an exchange student in Japan, is talking with Sho in the school cafeteria.
Ned: Hi, Sho. How's it going?
Sho: Oh, pretty well. Just one more week and the semester is finished. And I'm doing okay in all my
classes.
Ned: (1)  You know you are doing better than just "okay." You always get the
highest scores. But why do you work so hard?
Sho: Well, I take school pretty seriously. My parents are Chinese, and they had a hard time when
they first came to Japan.
Ned: You're Chinese? I didn't know that. {2) 
Sho: I'm not from China. My parents are. They are from Shanghai, but I was born and raised in
Japan.
Ned: Really? (3) 
Sho: For me, OK. But my parents had problems at first, because they didn't have much money. Then
they started their own business and began to do well. In my case, I'm more fluent in Japanese
than in my parents' language.

life was governed by a system called "feudalism." In a feudal society,
the king granted large pieces of land to noblemen and bishops. Peasants without land did most of
the work.
B. As a result, more and more people moved to towns and cities. Meanwhile, Christian conquests
had expanded trade routes to the East and given Europeans a taste for imported goods such as
wine, olive oil, and expensive textiles.
C. Thus, urban culture spread and a new era was born: the Renaissance. The Renaissance was a
time of great intellectual and economic change, but it was not a complete change: It had its roots
in the world of the Middle Ages.
D. During the 11th century, however, feudal life began to change. Agricultural innovations such as
the heavy plow and three-field crop rotation made farming productive, so fewer farm workers were
needed Å\ but thanks to the expanded and improved food supply, the population grew.
E. They planted and harvested crops and gave most of the produce to the landowner. In exchange
for their labor, they were allowed to live on the land. They were also promised protection in case
of enemy invasion.
F. Economic expansion led to port cities becoming larger and larger. Eventually, there were some
15 cities in Europe with a population of more than 50,000.

Six thousand miles from the US lies a country whose flag bears a striking resemblance to the
American one: alternating red and white horizontal stripes and, in the upper left-hand corner, a dark
blue square. Against this blue background is a lone white star Å\ the star of liberty. The flag is a
symbol of the history of the Liberian state, its relationship with America, and its search for its own
identity.
Liberia is a country of 43,000 square miles in West Africa ( 1 ) on the southwest by the Atlantic
Ocean. From ancient times through the 1700s, many ethnic groups from the surrounding regions
settled in the area, making Liberia one of Africa's most culturally rich and ( 2 ) countries. Settled in
the early 1800s by former slaves and freeborn Blacks from America, Liberia, whose name means
"land of freedom," has always struggled with its double cultural heritage: that of the settlers and that
of the native people.
In 1816, a group of Christians called the Quakers, and slave owners in Washington, D.C., formed the
American Colonization Society (ACS). The Quakers opposed slavery, and the slave owners opposed
the freedom of Blacks, but they agreed on one thing: Black Americans should be sent back to Africa.
The Quakers felt that freeborn Blacks and former slaves would ( 3 ) better chances for freedom in
Africa than in the US. They also saw sending Blacks to Africa as a way of spreading Christianity
through Africa. The slaveholders' motives were less noble: They viewed the sending of Blacks back to
Africa as a way of preventing slaves from rebelling.
Despite opposition from many Blacks and from white people who wanted to end slavery in
America, the program to send Blacks to Africa ( 4 ). In 1822, the first 86 Black Americans landed
on Cape Montserrado. They arrived with white agents of the ACS who would govern them for many
years. Many others followed, settling on land sometimes purchased, sometimes obtained more ( 5 ),
from native chiefs. The first years were a challenge: The settlers suffered from malaria and yellow
fever, which were common diseases in the area's coastal plains, and from attacks by the native
populations. The natives were unhappy with the ( 6 ) of the settlements along the coast, with the
settlers' efforts to put an end to the profitable slave trading in which some ethnic groups were engaged,
and with the settlers' attempts to spread Christianity in their communities. Despite these difficulties,
the Black settlers were ( 7 ) to show the world that they could create, develop, and run their own
country. And so they kept arriving.
In 1824, the area became known as Liberia. Over the next 40 years, 19,000 African Americans
settled in Liberia, along with some 5,000 Africans saved from slave ships, and a small number of West
Indian immigrants. The settlers recreated American society, building churches and homes that ( 8 )
Southern US plantations. And they continued to speak English. They also entered into a complex
relationship with the native people Å\ marrying them in some cases, discriminating against them in
others, but all the time attempting to westernize the traditional communities. After Liberia declared
its independence in 1847, Joseph J. Roberts, a freeborn Black from America was ( 9 ) Liberia's first
president. It had taken fewer than 25 years for the Blacks from America to begin to govern their own,

HB*(2J13H3tJfe)
free country. Roberts and his senators, all American-born, resolved to create a country ( 10 ) the
principles of justice and equal rights.
The settlers built schools and a university, and during the early years, agriculture, shipbuilding, and
trade greatly developed. Yet, as Liberia expanded its borders, a government of Blacks from America
located largely on the coast attempted to establish control over a growing native population located
largely in the interior. Over the next few decades, growing economic difficulties began to weaken the
state's ( 11 ) over the coastal native population. When the financially burdened ACS withdrew its
support, conditions worsened as Liberia tried to modernize its largely agricultural economy. The cost
of imports was far greater than the income ( 12 ) by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, and timber.
Liberia was also struggling under the burden of heavy loans, primarily from Britain. By 1909, the
government had no money left and was forced to borrow further from the US.
To bring in more income, the Liberian state leased large areas of land to private American
companies. The terms of the leases were strongly in favor of the companies. In 1930, the League of
Nations ( 13 ) these companies of engaging in "forced labor," which turned out to be true. The
government collapsed, and the new president dealt with the increasing frustration among his people by
( 14 ) harsh laws.
Despite its political, economic, and social troubles, Liberia, as the only free country in Africa, was a
model for other African countries struggling to achieve independence. William V. S. Tubman, president
since 1944, further highlighted the country's world profile by traveling abroad and allowing international
investment in Liberia. With this investment and the income from newly discovered mineral deposits,
he modernized parts of Liberia and built schools, roads, and hospitals. Tubman also expanded the
incorporation of local populations into the social and economic mainstream, ( 15 ) them, for example,
the right to vote. Under Tubman, Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations as well as of
the Organization of African Unity, and he supported the independence of other African states.

Climate change isn't new. Our planet is always changing and its environment rarely stays still for
long. There have been times in the distant past when levels of CO2 were much higher than they are
today, and Antarctica, a continent around the South Pole, was a tropical paradise. There have been
others when CO2 levels were much lower, and there was even ice in what are now tropical areas. But
over the past ten thousand years the Earth's climate has been unusually steady. We humans have
become used to a world where the temperature hasn't changed much. In other words, we have been
lucky. Now our steady reliable climate is changing, and this time nature isn't to blame. But how do
we know for certain that the world is warming?
When you're trying to determine whether the world's temperature is rising, the biggest problem is
^picking out a signal from the "background noise." Even in our relatively stable times, temperatures
move up and down from one day to another, from season to season, from year to year, and from place
to place. To be sure that the trend is occurring, you need to take precise measurements from many
different places around the world, and do so for an extremely long time. The world's longest survey is
the Central England Temperature Record, which is a result of the serious data-collecting habits of
seventeenth-century British natural scientists. It covers a large region of England and stretches back to
1659. ^The impressive record shows clear signs of warming, especially toward the end of the
twentieth century.
However, the record covers only a tiny part of the globe. Changes in England don't necessarily
reflect changes in the United States or Brazil. It also doesn't go back far enough to reveal just how
unusual our recent warm temperatures really are. How do they compare, for instance, to @the
apparent warm period in medieval times when grapes were grown in northern England? Or to the so-
called Little Ice Age several hundred years ago, when the River Thames in London froze over
completely so that people could gather and sell things on its solid surface? To answer these questions,
scientists have ^ come up with clever ways to expand the records geographically and extend them
backward in time. These records are written not by humans, but by nature.
Every year, the average tree grows a ring of new wood around its trunk. In a good year the ring will
be thicker, in a bad year, thinner. Researchers drill a small core into the side of the tree, about the size
of a wine cork, take out the wood, and then count and measure. By examining trees that are different
ages, cthey have been able to create a temperature record extending more than a thousand years and
from regions across northern Europe, Russia, and North America.
In the frozen north and south, ice also contains a record book of past climate. ^Each year's snowfall
buries the previous one. If temperatures are cold enough, the snow stays around long enough to be
squeezed into ice, clearly marking out the annual layers because summer's snow crystals are larger
than winter's, or because more dust blows in each year with the winter winds. The amount of snow
that fell in a given year gives clues as to how warm it was then.
By ^fitting together a variety of measures like these, researchers have come to remarkably similar
conclusions about temperatures over the last thousand years. The eleventh century was indeed
relatively warm, corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period. Temperatures were cooler in the
seventeenth century, corresponding to the Little Ice Age, and again in the early nineteenth century.
These warm and cool periods apparently were also fairly widespread.
However, it was only in the twentieth century that temperatures really began to rise noticeably. The
warming didn't happen regularly, but in two bursts Å\ which turns out to be important. The first one
occurred during the early years of the century and was marked enough that it made itself clearly felt.
The second burst of
ever since. And,
crucially, the temperatures we are
egan in the 1970s and has been gath<
experiencing now are hotter than they
the entire last
thousand years. Even the Medieval Warm Period was cooler than it is today.
Let's look at some numbers. On a global scale, from the 1910s to the 1940s, average temperatures
rose by about 0.3 ÅãC. After that there was a cooling of about 0.1 ÅãC, and since 1970 the world has
warmed by a further 0.6 ÅãC. These numbers might not sound like much, but they are very significant.

HB*(2/S3B&Jfc)
Although the temperature where you live can change by much more than this within the space of a
few hours or days, it is much more worrying when global annual averages show a clear upward trend.
Averaging in this way ^smooths out short-term differences and shows what's really happening. That's
why a small change in global average temperature can reflect a very big shift in climate. Speaking in
global averages, ^.only a few degrees separate us from the frozen world of the last ice age.

Taro is an exchange student at an American university. He is talking with John after class.
Taro: Hey, John. Can you help me with something?
John: Sure,
Taro: Yeste
at my apartment I received a notice saying not to hang my laundry out on the
balcony. I can't understand why!
John: Well, the owner might be worried that the buUding will look messy if people hang their clothes
outside. Do people hang them out like that in Japan?
Taro: Yes, of course. (2)  In fact, the weather programs on TV even tell people
which days will be good for drying.
John: That's interesting. I've never seen such a thing on television here.
Taro: (3)  If I'm not allowed to hang my laundry on the balcony when it's sunny,
how can I get it dry?
John: Around here, most people use a clothes dryer. There must be one in the basement of your
apartment.
Taro: Yes, but dryers are bad for the clothing. And they waste electricity.
John: (4)  But most Americans find dryers to be much easier and quicker than
natural drying.
Taro: I see, but I really don't like to share the dryers in the basement with other people. I'm afraid
that those dryers are dirty.
John: Well then, you may have to buy one of your own. If you check the advertisements on the
Internet, maybe you can find a cheap used one.

A. A growing body of research suggests that excessive social media use can have negative effects on
the mental health of people of all ages.
B. Not all researchers agree with this, however. Some argue that people who are lonely to begin
with, or shy, are more likely to spend long hours on Facebook. So loneliness is not the fault of
social media. In any case, widespread usage of social media is a twenty-first century phenomenon,
so we are still learning to understand and cope with it.
C. Adults may also become depressed when using Facebook but for a different reason. Findings by
the University of Michigan suggest that the more time adults spend using Facebook, the lonelier
they become.
D. A recent study of American teenagers found that 22 percent of them log onto social media sites
at least ten times a day. Many of them reported being subject to bullying or unwelcome sexual
comments online, causing what researchers described as "Facebook depression."
E. Adults' Facebook depression occurs, for example, when people sit alone looking at countless
photos of friends having fun or doing something interesting. They may negatively compare their
own lives to what they see on their screens.
F. Other research shows that the superficial nature of online friendships can also contribute to
feelings of loneliness. The greater the proportion of face-to-face interaction in people's lives, the
less lonely they feel.

A researcher at the University of California at Berkeley recently made a study of the nation's
walking habits and found that the average person in the United States walks less than 120 kilometers a
year Å\ about 2 kilometers a week, about 300 meters a day. I'm no stranger to being lazy myself, but
that's surprisingly little. I walk more kilometers just looking for the remote control for my TV.
Eighty-five percent of Americans, according to the Berkeley study, are essentially sedentary Å\ we
rarely get up from our seats and move around Å\ and 35 percent are totally sedentary. We have
become a nation of ( 1 ).
One of the things my wife and I wanted when we decided to move back to America from England
was to live in a manageably sized town ( 2 ) walking distance of a central business district. Hanover,
where we settled, is a typical small town in the Northeast United States, pleasant, calm, and compact.
It has a broad central square surrounded by the old and respected buildings of Dartmouth College, a
narrow Main Street, and green residential streets. It is, in short, an agreeable, easy place to go about
one's business on foot, and yet as far as I can tell almost no one does.
I ( 3 ) to the center of the town nearly every day when I am at home. I go to the post office or
library or bookstore, and sometimes, if I feel like it, I stop at Rosey Jekes Cafe for a cappuccino.
( 4 ) in the evenings my wife and I stroll up to the Nugget Theater for a movie or to a bar for a beer.
All this is a big part of my life and I wouldn't dream of doing it other than on foot. People have
gotten used to this unusual behavior now, but several times in the early days, acquaintances who were
passing by would slow down by the sidewalk and ask if I wanted a ride.
"But I'm going your way," they would ( 5 ) when I politely declined. "Really, it's no bother," I
would reply. "Well, if you're absolutely sure," they would say and depart reluctantly, even guiltily.
People have become so ( 6 ) using the car for everything that it would never occur to them to use
their legs and see what those lower limbs can do. It is worth mentioning that 93 percent of all trips
outside the property in the United States now involve the use of a car.
As with most old Northeastern towns designed for another age of transportation, Hanover ( 7 ) a
particularly friendly place for cars. Nearly any visit to town by automobile will be characterized by a
long and very annoying hunt for a parking space. To improve this, the local authorities are widening

that it is the absence of these features that makes the town desirable in the first place.
But it isn't really the authorities who are to blame. It is the people who wish to take two tons of
metal with them ( 9 ) they go. We have reached an age where college students expect to drive
between classes, where parents will get in a car and drive three blocks to pick up their children from a

Sometimes it's almost ridiculous. The other day I was in the little nearby town of Etna waiting to
bring home one of my children from a piano lesson. A car stopped outside the local post office and a

man about my age ( 11 ) and dashed inside and left the engine running. He was inside for about three
or four minutes, then came out, got in the car, and drove exactly sixteen feet to the general store next
door, and rushed in again, engine still running.
And the thing is, this man looked really fit. I'm sure he jogs great distances and plays sports and
does all kinds of very ( 12 ) things, but I am just as sure that he drives to each of those undertakings.
It's ( 13 ). An acquaintance of ours was complaining how difficult it was to find a place to park
outside the local gym. She goes there several times a week to walk on a running machine. The gym
is, at most, a six-minute walk from her front door. I asked her why she didn't walk to the gym and do
six minutes less on the machine. She looked at me as if I were ( 14 ) simple-minded and said, "But I
have a program for the running machine. It records my distance and speed and calorie-burn rate, and I
can adjust it for degree of difficulty." Her logic does not make any sense to me.
According to a recent editorial in a newspaper, the United States spends less than 1 percent of its
$25 billion-a-year highway budget on facilities for pedestrians. Actually, I'm surprised it's ( 15 ). Go
to almost any suburb developed in the last thirty years and you will not find a sidewalk anywhere.
Often you won't find a single pedestrian crossing. The fact is, we not only don't walk anywhere
anymore in this country, we won't walk anywhere. And if that isn't sad, I don't know what is.

Social researchers have long been interested in philosophical questions about the nature of
happiness, and whether or not people truly understand what will make them happy. Recently, some of
them have expressed concerns that people are focusing too much on achieving a state of happiness for
themselves and their families, and that they are impatient to reach this goal. In fact, a growing number
of experts now believe that the way some members of modern society are approaching the pursuit of
pleasure actually makes them feel miserable.
In the Western world, there is a very long tradition of "self-help." People try to improve themselves
emotionally, intellectually, or financially by means of conscious thought and behavioral change. cSelf:
help theories became more prominent during the twentieth century as the average person gained more
time for leisure, including reading. It was in the 1980s, however, that the self-help movement really
boomed. This came in response to rising rates of depression in Western society, arising from a difficult
period of social, economic and technological change.
Despite
Australian
intentions that
movement, critics, such as
researcher Hugh Mackay, believe it has started to harm society. He feels that it has
"become an industry, " because it has been taken over by public speakers and writers who present
unrealistic views of life, and try to sell happiness as a commodity. According to Mackay, the dominant
idea that is being sold is that people should always be bright, happy, and optimistic, because that is
their natural condition. As a result, it is ^increasingly common for people to think that if they are not
happy, there must be something mentally wrong with them. In the opinion of Russ Harris, a doctor
and author, these days "we refuse to accept that we can't always get what we want." In his recent
book The Happiness Trap, Harris argues that currently popular ideas about happiness are confusing
and are likely to make people miserable. Some doctors believe that current ideas about happiness are
partly f:, to blame for rising rates of heavy drinking, drug use, and obesity. The more we fail to find
genuine contentment, the more we seek to fill the gap with unhealthy behaviors that make us feel
good for a short time. But as we try to get rid of our feelings of sadness, failure and disappointment,
our rates of depression and anxiety continue to rise.
Along with the spread of the "feel-good, think positive" attitude encouraged by the modern self-
help industry, experts also note that a related "self-esteem movement" has appeared. According to
this outlook, the most important thing that parents can do for their children is to give them self-
esteem, or confidence in themselves. Therefore, parents are being urged by the "happiness industry"
of life coaches to praise their children at every opportunity in order to make them feel clever and
special.
Some of the world's leading happiness specialists now fear that ^,the self-esteem movement will
leave future generations hopelessly unprepared to deal with life's disappointments. Researchers are
concerned that many parents are raising children who, rather than learning the value of hard work, are
acquiring the belief that if they want something desperately enough they can have it. Carol Dweck,
professor of psychology at Stanford University, is troubled by the fact that parents are unwilling to let
their children struggle. Her research, based on observations of how children react when trying to solve
difficult problems, suggests that providing a lot of person praise (such as "you're talented, you're
special") only makes children worried. The pressure to merit all the praise they have been given
causes them to get upset, or lie about their performance. However, when given process praise (such as
"you focused well, you tried hard, you used good strategies") children enjoy trying difficult problems,
where they can apply their effort and strategies and show a strong spirit. Professor Dweck ^urges
parents to talk to their children not just about their victories but their struggles. Like Harris, she
maintains that accepting disappointments and unpleasant emotions, rather than trying to block them
out, is the key to building personal strength.
Already, mental health professionals are seeing the first victims of the self-esteem movement
entering therapy. In 2011, American therapist Lori Gottlieb reported that many young adults Å\
largely from happy, loving, advantaged homes Å\ were feeling confused, anxious and empty due to
overprotective parenting that focused too much on happiness and protected them from difficulties.
After entering ^ the real world, even minor obstacles became disasters for these young people.
The fact that some young people are dealing with ^issues like this inspired Hugh Mackay to write
that we must look beyond the pursuit of success and happiness as life's main goals. According to
Mackay, what is most important is developing our relationships with other people and our
responsibility for other people's well-being. Doing so supports the growth of communities, which are
essential to sustain us through our lives. If we focus only on happiness, we're neglecting the richness
of ^the full range of emotions. In fact, without knowing sadness, we couldn't appreciate happiness.

Huntley High School in Huntley, Chicago, Illinois, offers a blended
learning program. It allows
students to combine online learning with in-person teacher instruction.
Most days, 16-year-old Jason Zobott walks into Huntley High School in suburban Chicago around
7:30 a.m. like any high schooler might. (5)It's what he does the rest of the day that's not so typical.
Zobott is ,C1 enrolled in Huntley High's blended learning program, which merges Internet-based
instruction with a more traditional classroom setting. One-third of the school's 2,700 students are
enrolled. In 2015, the school is working toward enrolling the majority of its students.
"Having to work online makes ( 7 ) really accessible to do the work that I have to get done," said
Zobott, a top-ranked junior who balances a heavy load of extracurricular activities ( 8 ) schoolwork.
"I can learn on my own. I can work at the pace I want to work. And I learn the way I want to learn."
Huntley High School students and educators often refer to the program simply as "blended." It allows
teachers to write the curriculum, ( 9 ) about the focus. Unlike many traditional online learning
programs, students have the option of a flexible schedule during allotted blended learning days. Some
days they meet with teachers, and some days they work online, according to Anne Pasco, who heads the
school's educational technology efforts.
"In blended learning, we focus on the content. We don't focus on needing to cover X amount of
material," Pasco said. "Blended allows us to provide a stable environment that gives students the ability
to spread their wings a bit, while we have the safety net of pulling them back into class if they need it."
The "homegrown" program, which ,,nilaunched in 2011, gives students who struggle in certain content
areas more one-on-one time with teachers during the school day, Pasco said.
"Before blended, (11)that had to happen after school or before school or on Saturday or maybe not at
all, because we had too many other activities that encroach upon students' academic day," Pasco said.
"Now, this student can work one-on-one with that teacher during the school day."
Teachers can monitor students' progress and track lesson plans online to see how much time students
spend on a specific assignment. Teachers are allowed to restructure the class schedule based on students'
needs.
"There's actually much better accountability," said John Burkey, the superintendent for Huntley
High's school district, which includes about 9,500 students.
"Blended learning is not a panacea, and the success of the program isn't about spending a bunch of
money on technology. Rather, it's looking at what students actually need, and building a culture of
innovation to ( 12 ) those needs."
Burkey said there were plenty of questions about blended learning when it was first introduced to the
Chicago district in 2011. One concern: How was the district going to pay for it?
It turns out the blended learning program spends about $8,500 per student, less than the Illinois
average of $12,000 per student.
"We spend considerably less than the average school district. We don't have a lot of resources
compared to many districts," Burkey said.
"We did not put new money into this. What we did is change the old things we were doing and
changed them into new ways. It's really a change in how you think of high school. This is not a more
expensive option."
It has worked. In a study published in 2014 in eLearn magazine, 92% of students surveyed at Huntley
High said that they were satisfied with the blended learning experience, and Mno teachers reported
negative experiences with it. The school is also seeing higher standardized testing scores.

"The growth of blended certainly has corresponded with an overall rise in ACT scores," district
spokesman Dan Armstrong said. Since blended learning was implemented, Huntley High's average
composite ACT score has gone up nearly a point, from 22.1 to 23.0.
For 16-year-old Zobott, the advantage is time management. Three of his courses are advanced
placement. He also plays varsity basketball and club soccer and works part time. ,iaThe blended
learning program helps him better prioritize his busy schedule.
"Having blended gives us time to work on them, and get stuff done efficiently so we have more time
during the week to do other things," he said.
"What's still left to be determined about blended learning is how well students do in college or jobs
after they graduate," Burkey said.
"I think we're still in the infancy of this," Burkey said. "It's still such a new thing, and we're all
excited about it. My own kids are still in elementary and middle school, so they have not done blended
learning yet, but they definitely will when they get to high school."

E9 The radiation from the sun heats the surface of the Earth, which (7)in_turn heats the air above it,
causing it to rise. Air above a warm part of the planet will rise faster than the surrounding cooler air, so
more air slides in mto take its place in the low-pressure void left behind. So wind is born. And ,,,that is
the heart of the weather machine: heat and pressure differences bring cyclones, depressions,
thunderstorms and hurricanes, all blown across the surface of the globe by the wind.
But if wind is the engine of the weather, water is the fuel. Our weather ^ consists of a constant
interplay of water as vapor, liquid and solid ice. Like the formation process of rain, snow and storm, so
much M depends on water molecules changing from one state to the other that it is not surprising to find
that our planet lies at M precisely the right distance from the sun for water to exist in all three states at
the same time. Alone among the planets of the solar system, Earth has average temperature and
pressure that are very close to what scientists call the 'triple point' of water Å\ the combination of
temperature and pressure at which water can exist in all three of its physical states. wThis property of
our planet is one which allows us to exist.
Warm air, dry air, cold air and wet air all behave in different ways, and it is those qualities of air that
make it move and drive the engine of the weather. Although it may not seem obvious, moist air is less
dense than dry air, and so will always tend to rise above it. This is because of a very simple piece of
physics. A water molecule is made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms (H2O). Because
hydrogen atoms are the smallest and lightest atoms that exist, a molecule of H2O is much lighter than a
molecule of either oxygen (O2) or nitrogen (N2), which are what dry air consists of. In moist air, water-
vapor molecules have replaced some of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules, one for one, so any given
volume of moist air contains more lightweight molecules than does the same volume of dry air, and
therefore it is lighter and less dense. Warm air is less dense than cold air because, when they are warm,
all air molecules are more active, move around more and take up more space Å\ the air expands. Thus a
given volume of warm air will simply contain fewer molecules than that of cold air, so it will be less
dense.
In short, if there is warm, moist air it is going to move up and, at its very simplest, all of our various
forms of weather have that single action at their heart: the air rises, in comes the wind below; as the air
rises further it cools, the water vapor condenses to cloud and down comes the rain. That's all there is to it.

El The debate over how technology influences jobs is as old as the industrial era itself. In the second
decade of the nineteenth century, a group of English textile workers protested the introduction of
spinning frames* and power looms**, machines of the early Industrial Revolution that threatened to
leave them without jobs. Since then, each new burst of technological progress has brought another wave
of concern about a possible mass ( 1 ) of human labor.
On one side of the debate are those who believe that new technologies are ( 2 ) to replace workers.
In 1930, after the spread of electricity and the motor car engine, one economist predicted that such
innovations would lead to an increase in material prosperity but also to ( 3 ) unemployment. At the
beginning of the computer era, in 1964, a group of scientists and social theorists warned that automation
results in improving the productive capacity, requiring progressively less human labor. On the other side
are those who say that workers will be just fine. They point out that real wages and the number of jobs
have increased relatively steadily throughout the industrialized world even as technology has advanced
like never before.
In 1983, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief highlighted the debate through a clever
comparison of humans and horses. For many decades, horse labor appeared unaffected by technological
change. Even as railroads replaced the stagecoach and the Conestoga wagon***, the U.S. horse
population grew seemingly without end. The animals were ( 4 ) not only on farms but also in the
country's rapidly growing urban centers. But then, with the introduction and spread of the powerful and
efficient engine, the trend was rapidly reversed. As engines found their way into automobiles in the city
and tractors in the countryside, horses became largely ( 5 ). Then, the question is whether a similar
outcome is possible for human labor. Are autonomous machines and supercomputers indicating a
coming wave of technological progress that will finally sweep humans out of the economy? For Leontief,
the answer was yes. However, he missed a number of important points. Humans, fortunately, are not
horses and remain an important part of the economy.
Alfred Marshall, a British economist, in his foundational 1890 book, Principles of Economics, said,
"Human wants and desires are countless in number and very various in kind." Ever since Marshall,
people have linked unlimited wants to full employment. After all, who else ( 6 ) workers will be able
to fulfill all those wants and desires? We humans are a deeply social species, and the desire for human
connections carries over to our economic lives. We come together to appreciate human expression or
ability when we attend plays and sporting events. Regular customers often visit particular restaurants,
not only because of the food and drink, but because of the hospitality offered. In these cases, human
interaction is ( 7 ) to the economic transaction, not incidental to it. Humans have economic wants that
can be satisfied only by other humans, and that makes us deny that we will go the way of the horse.

College students Paul and Julie are talking on the campus.
Julie: Hi, Paul. How are you?
Hi, Julie. Fine, thanks. How are you doing?
Pretty good, thank you. So, when are we going to prepare for our presentation for Professor
Donald's class? Our presentation day is ( 1 ) soon. It's on Friday next week.
Oh, I totally forgot about that. I've been quite busy these days, and my schedule has been ( 2 ).
But I really want to spend enough time on the preparation since this is for one of my favorite
courses.
Yes. I'm with you there. That's one of my favorite courses, too, and Professor Donald is
fascinating.
How about this Tuesday evening? ( 3 )?
I'm sorry. I have to finish reading two chapters for my psychology class this Tuesday evening. The
paper is ( 4 ) Thursday.
Oh, ( 5 ). How about Friday afternoon? My third period is open.
Let's see... Friday third period... Oh, that's fine with me. I can definitely make it. Why don't we
reserve a study room at the Learning Support Center? We can borrow a computer, and there's a
whiteboard, and all that.
That sounds good. I'll go and book it. Oh, I can probably book it online. Are we going to use any
software for our presentation?
( 6 ). Actually, I have a suggestion for that. I recently found new presentation software we can
run online while presenting. I forgot the name of the software program, but...
Paul, I don't really care what kind of program we're going to use since I'm not a tech-person like
you, so I'll ( 7 ) you.
I'll check how to use it by Friday. By the way, did you attend the lecture given by Professor
Henderson?
Of course, ( 8 ), right? I've never skipped his lectures, and I never want to. His unique way of
looking at the Meiji Restoration completely changed my perspectives on the modernization of
Japan.
That was the best lecture I've ever attended! Oh, actually, he's giving a special seminar soon. The
information was going around on social media. It's about Japanese modernization in the late 19th
century.
Oh, that's something we shouldn't miss. When will it be held?
Let me check my memo... it actually starts from 3:00 this afternoon. What time is it?
Quarter to 3:00. Where will it be held?
It's at the Fraser Hall, Room 301. It's on the other side from where we are now. It will easily take
30 minutes ( 9 ). I don't want to miss it, though.
Hey, there's a bus right there. Let's get on! We can probably make it then.
Yes, you're right. Only 30 students can join the seminar. ( 10 ).
Let's give it a try anyway.

Several months ago I was reading an article in the magazine Newsweek on climate and energy when a
line jumped off the page: "Business as usual has started to read like the end of the world." Although
this conclusion may surprise many, it will not surprise the scientists who track global environmental
trends. For some time they have been saying that if these trends continue we will be in trouble. What
was not clear was what form the trouble would take.
It looks now as though food is the weak link, just as it was for many earlier civilizations. (a)We_are
entering a new food era, one marked by higher food prices, rapidly growing numbers of hungry people,
and an intensifying competition for land and water resources that has now crossed national boundaries
as food-importing countries try to buy or lease vast tracts of land in other countries.
Unlike earlier grain price hikes that were caused by singular events Å\ a drought in the Soviet Union
or a monsoon failure in India Å\ and were typically remedied by the next harvest, this recent rise is
trend-driven. Among the trends responsible are population growth, falling water tables, rising
temperature, ice melting, and the use of grain to produce fuel for cars.
In decades past, when grain prices climbed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture simply returned some
cropland idled under farm programs to production, but now that land is all in use. Suddenly, food
security has become a highly complex issue. Energy policy may affect future food security more than
agricultural policy. Eradicating hunger may depend more on the success of population control than that
of farmers. Raising water productivity may contribute more to future food security than expanding the
irrigation water supply would.
In his book The Collapse of Complex Societies, Joseph Tainter, a scholar, observes that civilizations
become progressively more complex as they evolve until eventually they cannot manage the complexity.
I was reminded of this as I watched Congress wrestling with the legislative program to combat global
warming, lowering its goals as this book was going to press.
International institutions are also wrestling with complexity. At the time of this writing, all eyes are
on the upcoming international conference on climate change in Copenhagen in early December. From
my vantage point, internationally negotiated climate agreements are fast becoming obsolete for two
reasons. First, since no government wants to concede too much compared with other governments, the
negotiated goals for cutting carbon emissions will almost certainly be minimal, not remotely approaching
the bold cuts that are needed.
And second, since it takes years to negotiate and ratify these agreements, we may simply run out of
time. This is not to say that we should not participate in the negotiations and work hard to get the best
possible result. ,uBut we should not rely on these agreements to save civilization.
Some of the most impressive climate stabilization advances, such as the powerful U.S. grassroots
movement that has led to an actual suspension of new coal-fired power plants, had little to do with
international negotiations. At no point did the leaders of this movement say that they wanted to ban
new coal-fired power plants only if Europe does, if China does, or if the rest of the world does. They
moved ahead unilaterally knowing that if the United States does not quickly cut carbon emissions, the
world will be in trouble.
We are in a race between political tipping points and natural tipping points. Can we cut carbon
emissions fast enough to save the Greenland ice sheet and avoid the resulting rise in sea level? Can we
close coal-fired power plants fast enough to save the glaciers in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan
Plateau, the ice melt of which sustains the major rivers and irrigation systems of Asia during the dry
season? Can we stabilize population by reducing fertility before nature takes over and stabilizes our
numbers by raising mortality?
On the climate front, everything seems to be moving faster. Only a few years ago summer sea ice in

the Arctic Sea was shrinking, but it was projected to last for several decades. The most recent reports
indicate that it could disappear in a matter of years.
Only a few years have passed since the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), but already the rise in carbon dioxide emissions, the rise in temperature, and the rise in
sea level are all moving faster than even the IPCC's worst-case scenario.
,^,The good news is that the shift to renewable energy is occurring at a rate and on a scale that we
could not imagine even two years ago. Consider what is happening in Texas. The 8,000 megawatts of
wind generating capacity in operation, the 1,000 megawatts under construction, and a huge amount in
development will give it over 50,000 megawatts of wind generating capacity (think 50 coal-fired power
plants). This will more than satisfy the residential needs of the state's 24 million people.
China, with its Wind Base program, is working on six wind farm mega-complexes with a total
generating capacity of 105,000 megawatts. And this is in addition to the many smaller wind farms
already in operation and under construction.
Most recently, a consortium of European corporations and investment banks has announced a proposal
to develop a massive amount of solar thermal generating capacity in North Africa, much of it for export
to Europe. In total, it could easily exceed 300,000 megawatts Å\ roughly three times the electrical
generating capacity of France.
And we could cite many more examples. The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources
of energy is moving much faster than most people realize. In the United States, for example, generating
capacity for wind increased by 8,400 megawatts in 2008, while that from coal increased by only 1,400
megawatts.
The question we face is not what we need to do, because that seems rather clear to those who are
analyzing the global situation. The challenge is how to do it in the time available. Unfortunately we
don't know how much time remains. Nature is the timekeeper but we cannot see the clock.

Developing regions made substantial progress towards universal primary education between 2000 and
2012, with the adjusted net enrolment rate in primary education increasing by 7 percentage points, from
83 percent to 90 percent. By 2012, one in ten children of primary school age was still out of school.
There was a marked decrease globally in the number of children out of school during the early 2000s Å\
from 100 million in 2000 to 60 million in 2007Å\ after which progress stagnated. There were still 58
million children out of school in 2012.
The regions of Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia, Caucasus* and Central Asia, Latin America, and the
Caribbean were close to achieving universal primary education, but have seen little progress since 2000.
Northern Africa, which had enrolment rates of 80 percent in 1990, had almost achieved universal
primary education by 2012. Western Asia and Southern Asia have also closed the gap towards universal
primary education, especially since 2000. Oceania made substantial progress between 1990 and 2012
with an increase in enrolment rates from 69 percent to 89 percent. The greatest improvement was in
sub-Saharan Africa**, where the adjusted net enrolment rate increased by 18 percentage points between
2000 and 2012.
However, sub-Saharan Africa faces a big challenge despite its impressive achievement: rapid
population growth. Compared to 2000, there were 35 percent more schoolchildren to accommodate in
2012. Countries in the region have also experienced armed conflicts and numerous other emergencies
which have kept children out of school. Hence, although the number of children enrolled in primary
education more than doubled between 1990 and 2012, from 62 million to 149 million, there were still
33 million children of primary school age who were not in school, of which 56 percent were girls.
Children in conflict-affected areas, girls from poor rural households and children with disabilities are
more likely to be out of school. An estimated 50 percent of out-of-school children of primary school age
live in conflict-affected areas, even though these areas are home to only 22 percent of the world's
primary-school-age population. Recent household surveys have revealed the negative effect of conflict

on school attendance. Poverty, gender, and location are the most pervasive factors linked to disparities
in school attendance in children of primary-school and lower-secondary-school age. ,,,An analysis of
developing countries between 2006 and 2012 shows that children of primary-school age from the
poorest 20 percent of households are over three times more likely to be out of school than children from
the richest 20
of households. Among the poorest households, girls are more likely to be
from education than boys. Disparities in school participation linked to place of residence also
persist. Rural primary-school-aged children are twice as likely to be out of school compared to their
urban counterparts.
Disadvantaged children, such as those with disabilities, are also at risk. These children often require
education adapted to their needs. However, in many developing countries, such personalized
approaches are either deficient or unavailable, which either prevents these children from going to school,
or slows their progress. Inclusive education requires increased attention to be paid to children with
disabilities as well as those who are more generally marginalized or vulnerable.
High dropout rates remain a major impediment to universal primary education. The achievement of
universal primary education requires both enrolment in, and completion of, the full cycle of primary
school education. Between 2000 and 2011, persistent early school leaving has slowed progress towards
this goal in developing regions. During this period, the proportion of pupils in developing regions
starting first grade who completed the last grade of primary education remained at 73 percent.
Between 2000 and 2011, progress was observed everywhere except in Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa,
and Western Asia. In Caucasus and Central Asia, Eastern Asia, and Northern Africa, nine out of ten
pupils who started primary school completed the last grade, bringing these regions closer to achieving
the universal primary education goal. However, only three out of five pupils in sub-Saharan Africa, and
only one in two pupils in Oceania, were able to complete primary school. Boys were at greater risk than
girls of leaving school earlier.
Children who are over-age for their grade are more likely to leave school early due to late entry,
repetition or the rising opportunity cost*** of attending school. Other critical factors for early school
leaving include travelling long distances from home to school, household poverty, the combination of
work and study, and opportunity costs. Consequently, good measures to tackle early school leaving
should address these factors and promote early interventions Å\ including wider access to pre-primary
school programmes to facilitate school readiness and timely school entry.
,,,The global number of illiterates remains high despite rising literacy rates. Over the past two
decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in youth and adult literacy rates and a simultaneous
decrease in the gap between male and female literacy rates. The youth literacy rate increased globally,
from 83 percent in 1990 to 89 percent in 2012. The adult literacy rate increased from 76 percent to 84
percent. Still, 781 million adults and 126 million youth worldwide lacked basic reading and writing
skills in 2012, with women accounting for more than 60 percent of both the illiterate adult and youth
populations.
M Given the fact that there has been little reduction in the number of children out of school since 2007,
a final push will be needed to ensure that as many children as possible are in school.

Infants begin producing their first recognizable words between Mroughly twelve and twenty
months. This, however, does not mean that they have no receptive lexicon before they can speak. The
child's receptive lexicon refers to the words she can understand, as ( 1 ) to her productive lexicon, the
words she can produce. Research shows that infants begin to recognize and understand a number of
words common to their daily routines long before they utter their first words. Using parental diaries,
Paula Menyuk and her colleagues found that at around twelve months mothers estimated that their
infants understood on average at least ten words. Infants' language comprehension increased to fifty
words by fourteen months, and to over one hundred by eighteen months. As far as the productive
lexicon is concerned, by twenty-four months most toddlers* can produce some fifty different words.
These first words tend to be similar across cultures and languages and include the names of familiar
people, objects, animals, food, body functions, and social routines or commands. Word comprehension
and production thus progress at separate rates. This difference is further supported by the finding that
while girls usually produce words earlier than boys, comprehension rates turn out to be far more equal
between the sexes throughout development.
It has long been presumed that when toddlers initially begin speaking, they produce nouns (like
"dog", "car", "bath", "shoe", or "bottle") before verbs (such as "go", "run", "drink", or "jump").
Understanding the meaning of nouns (which usually refer to relatively clear, mtangible whole objects)
might seem easier than learning the meaning of verbs. Perhaps this is because it is more difficult to
point to an action than to an object or a person. It is true that the earliest words produced by infants are
indeed often nouns. ( 2 ), Alison Gopnik has shown that verbs, adverbs, and the like appear early too.
Words like "gone" (used by infants to indicate that something is finished or someone has disappeared),
"bye-bye" (to refer to someone or something about to disappear), "done" or "there" (indicating
successful goal achievement), "uh-no" (denoting failure to achieve a goal), and "more" (re-requesting
food, a game, or an event) are also very common first words.
Rather than simply identifying first words, ( 3 ) is more revealing is discovering the function these
words have for the child. This provides clues as to why some words might develop before others. While
infants may copy their parents in simply naming things, the very earliest words produced are often called
proto-imperatives because they refer to something that the infant wants. These are not real imperatives
in the adult sense (a command like "give me a cookie now"). They are called proto-imperatives because
they fulfill the same function but are not expressed in the same linguistically formal way. So, for
instance, the toddler might say "juice" or "bottle" to indicate that she is thirsty and wants a drink, or
"door" to signal that she wants the door opened so that she can go out. Such instrumental uses of words
are designed to lead to a desired Moutcome, rather than simply refer to an object. But as soon as the
child discovers that words are more powerful than actions in controlling other people's attention, many
of her words become proto-declaratives Å\ words used to establish ..Joint attention and make a
statement about the world. Unlike proto-imperatives, proto-declaratives are not expressions of need or
wanting, but rather represent a sharing of information. So, for instance, the toddler might look at her
mother and say "bird" while pointing up to the sky, to convey the equivalent of "Look, there's a bird
flying past in the sky." Using language simply to share a common experience with the listener is ( 4 )
to human communication. Generally, animals only use communication in a proto-imperative way.
Early uses of words to make demands and share experiences exemplify what Katherine Nelson
considers to be the first function of word production: learning what words do. So the toddler's first task
in lexical development is to work out how words are used in regulating social interaction, thereby
affecting the behavior of others. She also needs to understand that the ( 5 ) word may be used both
proto-imperatively and proto-declaratively. So the toddler learns that she can use the single word
"juice" to express a number of different things: to ask for a drink, to refer to an image of a carton of
juice on television, or to signal that the little boy who just walked past is drinking juice.

TKotSfp'HA,
Some of my earliest memories M include sitting with my dad in his study every night when he
home from the office. I'd watch as he put his personal items away:,,,his watch, wallet, comb and
:vs would always occupy the same spot on the table every time. It was as if he could see invisible
lines drawn specifically for these things. Dad's comb was green. I heard he bought it when he married
Mum, which made the comb two years older than I was. Every night, he would smile, hand me the
comb and say: "Be a good girl and help Daddy clean it, OK?" was more than happy to do it. At age
five this mundane task brought me such joy. I would excitedly turn the tap* on, then brush the comb
with a used toothbrush as hard as I could. Satisfied that I'd done a good job, I would proudly return the
comb to Dad. He would smile at me, and place the comb on top of his wallet.
About two years later, Dad left his sales job and started his own wholesale** business. I started
primary school. That was when things started to change. Dad's business wasn't doing so well, and our
stable life started getting mshaky. ,|He didn't come home as much as he used to Å\ just a couple of
times a week. And when he did come home, it was always late and I'd already be in bed. I started to
get mad. Why did he take the risk and place the whole family in trouble? Over the years, I stopped
waiting for him to come home, and stopped going downstairs to check on him.
Today, I'm no longer a kid. Now 28, I've graduated from college and got a job. Dad's business has
so started to get back on track. Things are better now. Yet ,,,the uncomfortable silence between Dad
also started to get back on track. Things are
and me has persisted.
Two days before my birthday last year, Dad came home early. As usual, I helped him carry his bags
into his study. When I turned to leave, he said: "Hey, would you like to help me clean my comb? It's
been Å‚,a while since I last cleaned it." ,^1 looked at him with surprise, but took the comb and headed to
the sink. It's a new comb. This one's brown. I hadn't noticed that he'd changed it. He used to have the
green one, then a pink one that he gave to me as a present but took back when his green one broke.
It hit me then: why, as a child, helping my dad clean his comb was such a joy. That routine meant that
my dad was home early to spend the evening with Mum and I. It meant that he would watch TV with us
or play a few video games with me. It meant a happy and loving family.
I pass the cleaned comb back to Dad. He looks at it and smiles. But this time, I notice something
different. My dad has aged. He has wrinkles next to his eyes when he smiles, yet his smile is still as
heartwarming as before. It is the smile of a father who just wants a good life for his family. Dad
carefully places his comb on top of his wallet. After so many years, he still organizes his personal items
in the same Mmeticulous way. I guess some things never change. And for that, I'm glad.

"... 5, 1, 4, 1, 3 Å\ Done!" exclaims a fatigued old man.
"You look so exhausted. What have you been doing?"
"Counting the complete decimal expansion* of n backwards."
So goes one of Ludwig Wittgenstein's** philosophical jokes. Everything seems to have a beginning, but
some things appear to happen without one. Yet philosophy itself may have begun by M embracing this
contradiction. For it is Anaximander's*** solution to the first paradox in recorded history.
People are interested in tracing their ( 1 ) lines. Anaximander generalized this curiosity. He notes
that each human being begins as a baby who survives ,^,only if nurtured, inferring that the first human
beings were cared for by animals. Anaximander conjectured that the first human beings were born from
aquatic creatures who then ( 2 ) them.
But where did our animal ancestors come from? Here again Anaximander seems to be M ahead of his
time. He infers that these creatures had inanimate ancestors.
What were the ancestors of those ancestors? ( 3 ) long we continue the series, it makes sense to ask,
what happened before that? Yet it seems impossible for history to be without a beginning. Isn't that the
point of Wittgenstein's joke?
Perhaps some of Anaximander's contemporaries tried to formulate the absurdity precisely as an
impossible wait: if there is an infinite past, then an infinite amount of time would have had to elapse
@ exa 2017 AttBgniEe
-103-
HBÅ_BE*(2Åí2B%)t)
( 4 ) the present moment. An infinite wait is endless. But here we are at the present moment! From
this logic, it is concluded that the past must have a beginning.
Anaximander's paradox is, does each thing have an origin? He answers no: there is an infinite being
which sustains everything else but which is ,T,not grounded in anything other than itself. Anaximander's
reasoning can be reconstructed as an escape from an infinite regress. There are some things that now
exist but have not always existed. Anything which has a beginning ( 5 ) its existence to another thing
that existed before it. From this logic, it is concluded that there is something that lacks an origin.

Dan: Sure.
John: How long have you been studying here?
Dan: Three hours.
John: You're kidding.
Dan: No, I've been going over the material we studied in the math class yesterday. Since I'm not a math
person, it takes me a great deal of effort to ( 2 ) the rest of the class.
John: You must be tired out. Why don't you take a rest and grab a bite with me at the hamburger shop
which opened last week? I heard they serve a fantastic cheeseburger for just five dollars. Four
dollars and eighty-five cents, ( 3 ).
Dan: I'm afraid I have to study for the history exam after finishing the math.
John: Oh, come on. We still have more than two weeks before the exam.
Dan: Yes we do, but I don't have much time to study because of my part-time job.
John: Where did you say you worked?
Dan: At a frozen yogurt shop near the post office. I cannot take a day off even during the exam period
since it ( 4 ) to overlap with the shop's busiest time of the year. Handling both school and work
is much harder than I had expected.
John: That's (5)1 quit my job last year. But you are managing to perform extremely well in both
areas.
Dan: Thanks, though you're obviously ( 6 ). I'm not doing well in history. I got a C on the last exam,
as you know. Mr. Smith's exams are too hard for me. Until then, I had never gotten a C in my
life. History used to be my favorite subject, but I'm no longer so sure.
John: You shouldn't care so much about your grades. What are grades anyway? They're just some
( 7 ) reference points. They can't measure what a person really knows.
Dan: I guess you can afford to say such a thing because you got an A on the last exam. After all, grades
do count in various ways. But what ( 8 ) me about Mr. Smith's class is not so much his tough

exams as his way of teaching. He just requires us to memorize a bunch of facts without
challenging us to think about those facts. Memorizing numerous historical facts doesn't
necessarily mean we are learning anything, does it?
John: I disagree with you on that point. I believe memorization establishes the basis for a college
education where the ideas can be more fully examined.
Dam Hm, I never thought of it that way. That's pretty convincing. Did you really ( 9 ) that idea
yourself? I didn't think you were the type of person who would think that way.
John: What is that supposed to mean? But in fact, ( 10 ). That's actually what Mr. Smith himself said

Traveling to different countries can bring you a wealth of experiences. The problem is learning
how to interpret what you see. Appearances can be deceptive. Things aren't always what they seem. A
good example was my first day of sightseeing in Iran.
I'd gone off to visit a famous mosque. It was far from my hotel, but I was young, adventurous and
eager to explore. When I ,,,was ready to return to my hotel, I suddenly realized that I was lost.
Luckily, a friendly Iranian was standing nearby. I decided to ask him for directions. "Excuse me," I
inquired. "Can you tell me how to get to this hotel?" He immediately pointed north and announced,
"It's that way!" His quick reply and confident manner convinced me that he was right.
Off I went in the direction he indicated. But the I A 11 went, the more I began to doubt his advice.
"(b)This is wrong," I thought. "I'd better ask someone else." I approached a second friendly Iranian and
asked for directions. He immediately pointed south and, in a voice full of confidence, said, "Go that
way!" "Hmm," I thought. "That doesn't seem right, either. I need another opinion."
I asked a third person. Then a fourth. Then a fifth. In each case, the same thing happened. They all
replied immediately and spoke confidently, but gave different answers and pointed in random directions.
Strange!
Finally, I decided to ignore their advice and trust my own instincts. I began walking and got back to
my hotel 20 minutes later.
I left Iran frustrated by the way I'd been misled. The people were so nice, but why had they lied to
me? Were they ^teasing me because I was a foreigner? Did they hate Canadians? I had no idea.
Many years later, I became a university professor and began studying world countries and cultures.
One day, I found a book about Iran. In Chapter 3, there was a section on asking for directions. I read
on eagerly!
"iMHospitality is very important in Iran," the book stated. "When a foreign visitor needs help and
asks a question, it's rude to say that you don't know. Iranian culture requires that people give an answer
immediately, even if it's wrong."
Thanks to that book, I finally understood what had happened all those years ago. My first impressions
were wrong. The people I had met in Iran weren't trying to mislead me. They were trying to help me! I
just didn't realize it.
There are two lessons we can learn from this story. The first is that you shouldn't jump to conclusions,
especially in cross-cultural interactions. The second is that it's important to learn about other cultures.

Think back over the last month Å\ have you read any fiction?
Many young people probably haven't. They may have spent their free time online, posting Facebook
or Twitter updates, or streaming episodes of The Big Bang Theory*1. Or they may have dedicated it
( 1 ) keeping up-to-date with the news, reading course materials, or professional journals. For these
young people, reading stories and novels, after all, is old-fashioned, ^irrelevant, and a waste of time.
Or is it? Recent research has shown, ( 2 ), that reading fiction is good for your brain. Some benefits
have been known for a while. Language teachers are well aware that reading extensively in the target
language helps students acquire vocabulary, syntax, and, more generally, a feel for the way the language
is used. Students can also learn about the culture, people, and places associated with their language of
study. And all this is more likely to happen when you are reading fiction because a good novel draws
in: You want to know the people better and find out what happens, so you keep reading.
School teachers also know all about the positive effects of reading, starting with parents reading stories
aloud to their children. Numerous studies have found that children who are read to regularly become
better readers themselves and generally perform better in school Å\ not surprising, ( 3 ) the
importance of reading for most school subjects. Children who become habitual readers get better grades
and test scores throughout their academic careers.
But that's only the beginning of what reading can do for you. In recent years, thanks to fMRI
scanning*2, scientists have learned a great deal about what happens in the brain during reading. The

-109

traditional view was that reading involved mainly the language centers of the brain, particularly Broca's
and Wernicke's areas*3, which are responsible for interpreting written symbols and transforming them
into meaning. Scientists now believe that much more of the brain is involved.
In a recent study in Spain, for example, researchers scanned participants' brains while they read words
with strong associations of smell, such as "perfume" or "coffee." The scans showed activity in the
primary olfactory cortex*4 Å\ the part of the brain that deals with smell. When participants read words
with no smell associations, such as "chair" or "key," there was no activity there.
A similar study in France examined brain activity while participants read about body movements.
Their brains were scanned while they read sentences such as "John grabbed the stick." and "Paul kicked
the ball." Reading these sentences stimulated activity in the motor cortex*5, the part of the brain that
coordinates body movements. Furthermore, within the motor cortex, the activity changed location
according to whether the sentences mentioned a leg or an arm Å\ as if the participants had actually
moved their own leg or arm.
In fact, it seems that reading about something is a lot like the real experience, ( 4 ) the brain is
concerned. And where are you most likely to find a wealth of suggestive details and colorful
descriptions of people, places, situations, and actions? In fiction, of course. Reading a good novel
stimulates all kinds of neurological activity in your brain.
But, as any ,n,avid reader is well aware, the experience of reading a novel is far more than gymnastics
for the brain. In fiction, you can enter into the heads of characters and try to imagine what they are
thinking and feeling. You can explore unknown emotional territory and experience novel social
situations. According to Keith Oatley and his colleagues in neuropsychology at the University of
Toronto, fiction provides us ( 5 ) a "simulation of reality" and gives the brain an opportunity to
practice understanding and relating to other people. In fact, studies have found that people who read
fiction are better able to guess the emotions of others than people who don't. As he has written, "We
have discovered that fiction at its best isn't just enjoyable, it measurably enhances our ability to
empathize with other people."
( 6 ) from a better understanding of an individual's motives and actions, fiction also gives the brain
practice in understanding human relations, what happens when people get together. Oatley says: "Just
as computer simulations of atmospheric pressure, winds, and humidity are used to generate weather
forecasts, novels can be thought of as simulations of how people react to combinations of social forces."
Research seems to confirm this: The more practice you get in navigating the complexities of fictional
social worlds Å\ whether with Anna Karenina*6 or Harry Potter*1 Å\ the better your social skills will be
in real life.
Oatley's theory about fiction has sparked interest in various fields, more notably in business. In a blog
post by Anne Kreamer for Harvard Business Review, "The Business Case for Reading Novels," she
discusses the importance of emotional intelligence (the ability to understand people's emotions) in the
business world. "Emotions have an impact on the ,,,,bottom line," she writes. She mentions studies
showing that people with higher emotional intelligence receive the biggest pay raises and are promoted
more. If emotional intelligence is so important, how can we improve it? Her answer is, by reading
fiction. "It's when we read fiction that we have the time and opportunity to think deeply about the
feelings of others, really imagining the shape and flavor of alternative worlds of experience.
Though business people might find the idea of learning from fiction surprising, Oatley's studies serve
only to confirm what many others know from their experiences as teachers or readers. Oatley himself
notes that there is nothing really new about his theory. "Two thousand years ago," Oatley writes:
"Aristotle claimed that poetry Å\ he meant the epics of Homer*8 and the tragedies of Aeschylus*9,
Sophocles*10, and Euripides*11, which we would now call fiction Å\ is a more serious business than
history. History, he argued, tells us only what has happened, ( 7 ) fiction tells us what can happen,
which can stretch our moral imaginations and give us insights into ourselves and other people."

Doctor: Well, congratulations, Mrs. Canterbury, you were right, fe7) and if your dates are correct
you're probably about four weeks pregnant.
Patient: Oh, so the baby'll probably be born in October.
Doctor: Around then, yes. We'll be able to be more precise (28) .
Patient: When will that be?
Doctor: It's usually done at about twelve weeks. By that time we can usually get a clear picture of the
baby. Now, I take it (29) ?
Patient: I haven't really thought about it.
Doctor: Well, since it's your first, it's probably best. We'll check your details later and sort out the
hospital.
Patient: So you'll let me know which hospital it'll be?
Doctor: Yes, that's right. Now I just want to ask you (30) . Do you eat sensibly?
Patient: Generally yes, though I do skip meals sometimes when I'm rushed.
Doctor: Well, it's very important now that you make sure you eat nutritious food regularly.
Patient: I realize that. Um, does it matter what I eat?
Doctor: Yes, there are certain things you need to steer clear of, like shellfish and soft cheese. You don't
want to risk any kind of food poisoning. Now, what about alcohol?
Patient: A couple of glasses now and then, but I haven't drunk enough to have a hangover for ages.
Doctor: Good, we'll keep it that way. Alcohol should really be avoided in pregnancy, but the occasional
single drink is OK. Do you smoke?
Patient: Occasionally, but it's not a real habit.
Doctor: Well, try to give it up altogether. With a growing baby inside you, you need to be very careful
what you are putting into your body. Are there any questions you'd like to ask?
Patient: No, not at this time.
Doctor: So, congratulations, Mrs. Canterbury.

Once said, we had to agree. If you looked at Dodi from behind when he was sitting down, you could
see how big his thirteen-year-old middle and hips had grown. He had become quite ( 2 ) too,
preferring to relax in front of the fire rather than play in the garden as he did before. His extra weight

He had refused to eat anything except a particular brand of instant meal for a very long time. The label
said, "Guaranteed real tuna!" In fact, there was ( 3 ) tuna, 10% according to the small print. It was
made largely from chicken parts, such as necks and feet, and also contained corn, vegetable oil, and sugar.
Dodi is our cat and we know that cats do not eat sugar, corn, or vegetable oil in normal circumstances.
( 4 ), that's what we had been feeding him. It said on the packets that it was "scientifically prepared,"
but now we realize it was prepared economically. While there are good reasons for pets to eat waste
from human food production, it is ( 5 ) to feed them types of waste they would never naturally eat,
and which actually make them fat and unhealthy. In the case of Dodi, who had become used to the
flavors added by the food scientists, it was ( 6 ) necessary to persuade him to eat healthier cat food.

B Korean language study has been quickly growing in popularity across the United States. The
Modern Language Association found that the number of college students registering for Korean language
ttJta 2017 ÅíH*^AI^SIE8? •
Sffj&S*
114
courses increased by almost 45% between 2009 and 2013. This happened at a time when total language
course registration was falling in universities.
Korean entertainment is one reason why interest in Korean language classes has increased so much in
a short period. The Modern Language Association's Rosemary Feal says that it is the biggest increase for
any language at the university level. "Many students say they really want to get inside Korean culture
and they want a better understanding. Clearly, language gives us access to culture and cultural expression."
Korean popular music is called K-pop. It has attracted fans from around the world, thanks to the
Internet and websites like YouTube, which carry South Korean pop music and dramas. The growing
popularity of this entertainment is called the "Korean Wave."
"As a professor of humanities, to look at a country that's creating its reputation globally through
cultural production is very exciting," says David Schaberg, head of the Division of Humanities at the
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). "Of course, it attracts students, and it means more
Americans who may have had nothing at all to do with Korea will now be interested in the study of
Korean language and culture," he says. That's the case for Korean language student, Persida Radu. "I
actually first got into Korean pop and then the dramas they show, and then finally became interested in
learning the language."
Rosemary Feal says another reason for the increase in students learning Korean is that children of
Korean immigrants want to learn the language of their ancestors' homeland. This type of language
student is called a heritage learner. According to Feal, there is a connection between immigration
patterns and trends in language popularity, as future generations born in the U.S. often want to learn
their family language.
This is true of John Park, who is taking a class for heritage speakers at UCLA. "I don't speak Korean
too well, and of course I want to communicate with my parents and grandparents, so I'm studying it to
learn how to speak, read, and write more effectively," he explains.
UCLA Korean professor Sung-Ock Sohn says South Korea's economic power is yet another reason
why more students want to learn Korean. "Now in this global economy, Korean brands such as
Hyundai, Samsung, and LG are very well known, and recognized by everyone. Therefore, students are
interested in learning the Korean language, and ability in Korean gives them many opportunities for
international job positions."
UCLA's David Schaberg says this trend is also affecting American culture: "What we're really seeing is
a small change in American culture, as it becomes more Asian, or at least opens itself to more Asian
influences."
Language researchers say the trend of growing student numbers in Korean language classes shows no
sign of ending soon, especially as the popularity of K-pop continues and second and third generation
Koreans seek to explore their heritage.

C. The danger, however, is much more serious for animals like small dogs, which can die from eating

7] Music is unusual among all human activities because no human culture now, or at any time in the
recorded past, has lacked music.
A. This led to the building of concert halls, dedicated to the performance of music, in the last few
centuries.
B. Indeed, some of the oldest objects found in places where early humans lived are musical
instruments, such as flutes and drums.
C. However, a distinction arose in Western culture about 500 years ago that cut society into two
classes: music performers and music listeners.
D. These discoveries show that for most of human history, music making was a natural activity like
breathing and walking, and everyone participated.

A: Is that a guidebook to Hawaii that you're looking at? Is this your first trip?
S: Well, I've never been to Hawaii before, but it's the second time I've been to the U.S. I visited my
uncle in New York two years ago. And I also went to Germany on a study abroad program from high
school last year, so this is the third time that I've been out of Japan.
A: Are you still at high school now? You look older than that.
S: Well, I just graduated and this is my graduation trip. I decided that I wanted to see Hawaii. Japanese
people tend to really love the lifestyle there and I want to experience it for myself. I also want to
travel abroad alone. When I went to Germany and New York, I was with other people and that made
the experience very different.
A: Do you have fixed plans for the whole time you are in Hawaii or are you going to decide what to do
when you get there?
S: Well, I have booked a hotel in Waikiki for the first six days so I can relax and maybe do a bit of
swimming. I'm also thinking of taking some surfing or scuba classes while I'm in Waikiki. Apparently,
you can get classes for water sports pretty cheaply. After that, I'll decide whether I want to stay in
the same place or move to somewhere else. I'll make a final decision about what to do afterwards.
A: It sounds like it's going to be quite a long trip. mI get the impression that most Japanese tourists only
stay about a week. When will you be going back to Japan?
S: I'll be in Hawaii for 18 days altogether. But you're right, most people from Japan don't have such
long holidays. I'm lucky because I'm still a student and I can spend a bit more time on vacation.
After the first week I'm thinking of maybe taking a flight to one of the other islands but I'm not sure
where yet. I'd like to spend some time in an area that's quieter and more relaxing. I hear that
Waikiki can be pretty lively and sometimes a bit noisy.
A: Well, yes. It can be quite noisy, especially in the area that's right next to the beach and it's really
built-up with lots of hotels, shops and restaurants. I would definitely recommend you take a trip to
somewhere quieter if you have the chance. Maui is wonderful, for example. Or you could just go
across to the other side of Oahu, the island where Honolulu is, where it's also a lot quieter than in
Waikiki. It's really easy to get around on Oahu. You can just catch a local bus, which is cheap. I
especially recommend that you visit the North Shore and the Polynesian Cultural Center.
S: Do you live in Hawaii?
A: Yes, I live on the other side of the island of Oahu from Honolulu, on the North Shore that I just
mentioned. The scenery is really spectacular.
S: Have you been on vacation in Tokyo, or were you working?
A: It was a bit of both, actually. I had to visit my company's office in Tokyo for some meetings, but I
also had enough time to do some sightseeing. This time I actually managed to climb Mount Fuji!
They say that everybody should do it at least once, but if you do it more than once, you are a fool. I
suppose that now I've done it I can relax. I don't have to climb Mount Fuji when I go to Japan next
time! Seriously, though, I really enjoyed it. I was with a group of people from work and the
experience really made us feel close to each other. Seeing the sunrise from the top of the mountain

B9 There was once a shoemaker who had become so poor (through no fault of his own) that ,,he had
hardly any leather left Å\ only enough to make one pair of shoes, in fact. He cut them out in the
evening, intending to start work on them in the morning, and then went to bed. ,,,He had a clear
conscience, so he said his prayers and then slept peacefully.
Next morning he woke up, had a bite of dry bread, and sat down at his bench, ,qlonly to find the shoes
completed already. He was astonished. He picked them up and looked at them closely from all angles.
Every stitch was neat and tight; ^nothing was out of place. He couldn't have done better himself.
A customer soon came in, looking for shoes of just that size, and liked them so much he bought them
at once for a good price.
That gave the shoemaker enough money to buy leather for two pairs of shoes. So ,g)he did that, and as
before he cut them in the evening, meaning to carry on in the morning in good heart. But he had no
need to: when he got up, the shoes were already made, just as before, stitched as if by a master
craftsman. He soon found customers for them, and that left him enough profit to buy leather for four
pairs; and next morning they were finished, and he sold them, and ^so it went on. Each evening he cut
the shoes out, next morning they were finished, so that pretty soon he was making a good income, and
not much later he was a wealthy man.
One evening not long before Christmas, he cut out a number of shoes as usual, and then said to his
wife just as they were going to bed: 'Why don't we stay up a bit tonight and see if we can find out who's
been helping us?'
His wife thought that was a good idea, and they lit the lamp and hid behind a rail of clothes hanging
up in the corner of the workroom.
At midnight two little naked men squeezed in under the door and jumped up to the workbench, where
they set to work at once, sewing together the cut-out shoes ,,,at a speed the shoemaker could hardly
EÅítt2017Å}HÅ}^AraSSRER •

believe. They worked until they'd finished every one, and then they put the shoes on the bench and
went out under the door.
In the morning the shoemaker's wife said, 'I think we should do something in return for those two
little men. After all, they've made us rich, and there they are, (8) running about in the cold with nothing
on. I'm going to sew them some shirts and jackets, and some underwear and some trousers, and knit a
pair of stockings for each of them as well. And you can make them each a little pair of shoes.'
'That's a good idea,' said the shoemaker, and they set to work.
That evening, they set the clothes out on the bench instead of the cut-out shoes, and hid again to see
what the little men would do. At midnight they came in and leaped up to the bench as before, intending
to start work, and then they stopped, looking at the clothes and scratching their heads in puzzlement.
Then they realized what they were for, and jumped for joy, put them on at once, and preened1
themselves, singing:

'We're finer than we were before Å\
We shan't be cobblers2 any more!'

They leaped about like a pair of kittens, on the chairs, the bench, the hearth3, the windowsill, and
finally they darted4 under the door and were gone.
They never came back, but the shoemaker prospered. All his work went well from then on, and he
and his wife lived happy and wealthy till the end of their days.

Whpn Adrian Rlark met his Italian Dartner 10 vears aeo. he was determined to learn her home
language. Having successfully picked up French a decade earlier when he lived in France, he felt (1)the
challenge was attainable.
"I was blown away by how hard it was to learn French, but I came back speaking it pretty well," says
Black, who is now 50. But getting to grips with Italian has been a much tougher process, he explains: "I
feel like French is deep down in my head somewhere, but with Italian it will take a lot more effort for me
to get to that level. "I've noticed that my brain isn't as good as it was, and I'm pretty sure I don't retain
stuff as well as I used to. It iust doesn't all click as easily as it used to."
It's often said that
not true. For much
can't teach an
the history
modern
new tricks. Actually this proverb is, for the most part,
the adult brain was believed to be a fixed
structure that, once damaged, could not be repaired. But research published since the 1960s has
challenged this assumption, showing that it is actually a highly dynamic structure, which changes itself in
response to new experiences, and adapts to injuries Å\ a phenomenon referred to as neuroplasticity2.
Collectively, this body of research suggests that people can never be too old to learn something new, but
that the older they are, the harder it is for them to do so. This is because neuroplasticity generally decreases
as a person gets older, meaning the brain becomes less able to change itself in response to experiences.
Some aspects of language learning become progressively more difficult with age, others may get easier.
"Older people have larger vocabularies than younger ones, so the chances are your vocabulary will be as
large as a native," says Albert Costa, a professor of neuroscience who studies bilingualism at the
Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. Picking up a new language's vocabulary is much easier for adults
than learning the rules that govern its grammar or syntax. This is because new words can be easily mapped
on to a learner's pre-existing knowledge. But older learners are less likely to have good pronunciation or
accent, since the phonemes, or sounds, of a language are picked up naturally by children.
Learning Å\ and using Å\ a foreign language seems to improve what psychologists3 and neuroscientists4
call ^executive function, which refers to a hypothetical set of mental processes that enable us to vary
our thoughts and behaviours from one moment to the next, depending on ^the task at hand.
"Using two languages seems to have consequences not only for executive functions, but also for other
processes," says Costa. "It's like learning to juggle, the idea being that you have to juggle two balls
every time you speak. Some of the work is controversial, so we need more data to have a definite answer."
Despite the difficulties, Black regards learning foreign languages as fun, and treats the endeavour like a
puzzle that has to be solved. "I'm doing it partly to keep my brain active," he says. "When you have
some success and can express yourself, it feels like you're using different parts of your brain that you
weren't using before."
Indeed, research shows that bilingual children use the same brain regions for both languages if they are
learned during childhood, whereas learning a second language later on in life recruits different regions
from those involved in using one's mother tongue. And learning a foreign language, ,f ,much like learning
to play a musical instrument, does indeed appear to be a good way of exercising one's brain, and
keeping it healthy, throughout life.

Is there intelligent life on other planets? For ( 7 ), scientists said "No" or "We do not know." But
today, this is changing. Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers. They believe intelligent
life exists somewhere in the universe. They also think we will soon contact these ( 8 ).
Why do Shostak and Barnett think intelligent life exists on other planets? The first reason is ( 9 ).
Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. This is too long, say Shostak and Barnett,
for only one planet in the ( 10 ) universe to have intelligent life. The second reason is ( 11 ) Å\ the
universe is huge. ( 12 ) such as the Hubble Telescope "have shown that there are at least 100 billion...
galaxies," says Shostak. And our galaxy, the Milky Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets
that circle these stars might be similar to Earth.

mm Do you like chocolate? Most people do. However, few people know much about its main
ingredient, cocoa, or the people who grow it. Over two thirds of the global cocoa supply is produced by
poor fanners in West Africa. They sell it to middlemen, who sell it to rich trading companies. They

deliver it to the chocolate manufacturers, who sell their product to supermarkets and other retailers.
In the year 2000, Americans spent 13 billion dollars on chocolate. That represents a lot of profit for
everybody in the chocolate business except the poor farmers and plantation workers who grow the
cocoa. They make so little money that many of them cannot afford to feed their families or send their
children to school. Indeed, many of the workers are children themselves.
People working for development agencies realized that the farmers they were trying to help would
never escape from poverty unless they could obtain a fair and stable price for their product. (,0)This
realization led to the evolution of the fair trade movement in the 1970s. In 1989, an NGO in the
Netherlands introduced the Max Havelaar Fairtrade label certifying fairly-traded products. This was
followed by Cafe Direct, an extremely successful fair trade coffee company. In 1994 the newly-created
Fairtrade Foundation, based in Britain, awarded its first Fair Trade Mark to a chocolate bar made by a
company which guaranteed to pay cocoa growers a fair price for their product. British supermarkets
now sell over 180 different fairly-traded products, including coffee, tea, fruit juice and wine, fresh and
dried fruit, chocolate and snack bars.
What exactly does fair trade entail*? It essentially means guaranteeing farmers and artisans** a better
provide farmers with a good, stable income. They also help growers to set up cooperatives, provide
training and equipment, low-interest loans, education and health care, help communities to build wells
and schools, and provide emergency assistance following natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods.
Fair trade may seem to be a form of charity, but it is not; it is simply a policy of giving people a fair deal.

Dan Quayle*, former Vice President of the United States of America, made a spelling mistake that was
to haunt his political career. In 1992 he presided over a spelling contest at a school in New Jersey,
where he read out words written on flashcards which the children then wrote on the blackboard. One of
the words he was given to read out was potato and twelve-year old William Figueroa duly wrote the
word on the board. "You've almost got it," replied Quayle, "but it has an 'e' on the end". The boy
corrected his effort, I (D I adding the additional "e". There is, however, no "e" on the end of potato;
an "e" is added in the plural potatoes, but it is not found in the singular. Speaking on a TV show a few
days later, William Figueroa (now known as the "potato kid") said that he knew Quayle was wrong, but
thought he should follow the Vice President's instructions.
Dan Quayle's error earned him worldwide derision and his howler was front-page news throughout
the USA and the UK. ,,He evidently considered it a defining moment of his political career: he and
of office
five months later. When he launched his
unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2001, his largest obstacle was termed the "potato factor". He
devoted an entire chapter of his autobiography to the incident, claiming that the word was incorrectly
spelled on the flashcard, and complaining at the media's handling of it. But this was not Dan Quayle's
first orthographic blunder: the family Christmas card of 1989 reportedly carried the slogan "May our
nation continue to be the beakon of hope to the world," with the misspelling beakon for beacon.

[I] Still, as industries from manufacturing to transportation to journalism are overtaken by artificial
intelligence, the sheer number of new openings in more human service-related industries may not keep
up with the number of other jobs lost. In the past increased productivity has always been a direct cause
of economic growth and job growth, since labor has always driven production. A robot work force,
however, can drive productivity and growth on its own, getting rid of jobs in the process. That might
mean the whole concept of exchanging labor for pay will start to break down.

"In Defense of Traditional Marriage" by Noah Reinbos (2014)
R Today, the vast majority of governments around the world do not allow couples of the same sex to
marry. Why? Answering this is by no means easy. Our response should not be based on blind
prejudice. Instead, we should reject such a critical change on economic, political and cultural grounds.
(D The major religions of the world have long agreed that marriage should be between a man and a
woman. As the Supreme Court of Minnesota in the USA found in 1971, "The definition of marriage
as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the raising of children within a family, is as old as
the Bible." Other major religions also [ 1 ] that marriage is allowed only between a man and a
woman. Thus, though some countries have very recently legalized homosexual marriage, other
societies have an equal right not to, based on traditions going back thousands of years.
(D However, behind such religious arguments, which ultimately depend on the interpretation of sacred
texts, lies practical economic wisdom. Heterosexual couples, by raising children, contribute to society.
In recognition of this, most societies reward them with various benefits such as reduced taxation. Such
marriage allowances are given by choice and society can choose not to give the same benefits to same-
sex couples. How the state organizes itself and rewards its citizens are political questions, where the
view of the majority must prevail. In other words, marriage is [ 2 ].
c In fact, wherever marriage benefits are offered more widely, people usually do not even bother to get
married. Take Scandinavia, for example. Sweden began offering benefits to same-sex couples in
1987. Denmark followed in 1989 and Norway in 1993. According to a 2004 report by Stanley Kurtz,
PhD, from 1990 to 2000, the number of unmarried parents with children in Norway rose from 39% to
50% and Sweden's rose from 47% to 55%. Similarly, the out-of-wedlock birthrate in Denmark rose
25% during the 1990s, and approximately 60% of first born Danish children now have unmarried
parents. As Kurtz concludes, "Marriage is slowly dying in Scandinavia." Promoting same-sex
"marriages" [ 3 ] Scandinavia.

D Political considerations like these illustrate the vital link between marriage and children. The most
important justification for marriage is that it allows couples to raise children in secure, stable families.
Children need both a mother and a father. Should governments really adopt a measure which denies
this? Several studies show that girls who are raised apart from their fathers are at higher risk for early
sexual activity and teenage pregnancy; children without a mother are deprived of the emotional
security and loving advice that mothers provide. Furthermore, research has [ 4 ] that children with
1 AfUi n n nv n-otr rxorQ-n fc nm rMArQ trt An no nrct in li AmAfiQViial Kali OTTi rtr fViamoaUraci Tucl/ai* n-rtfi
lesbian or gay parents are more likely to engage in homosexual behavior themselves. Tasker and
Golombok (1997) found that 25% of [ 5 ] young adults raised by lesbian mothers had engaged in a
homosexual relationship, compared to 0% of those raised by heterosexual mothers. [ 6 ] same sex
marriage will only encourage this trend. [ 7 ]
c At root, the idea of same-sex marriage presents a challenge to the traditional concept of marriage
itself. Granting same-sex couples full legal status is the start of a slippery slope. As argued by Ryan T.
Anderson, scholar at The Heritage Foundation, "In recent decades, marriage has been weakened by a
radical view that makes adults' desires more important than children's needs... Redefining marriage to
include same-sex relationships would be the logical result of this idea, and to do so [ 8 ] emotional
intensity as the only thing that sets marriage apart from other bonds."
c [ 9 ] can dispute that such trends will accelerate if same-sex marriages become more common.
Furthermore, it is likely that more children will grow up in unstable households. The broad social
costs are simply too high, compared with the benefits of allowing individual members of same-sex
couples to express their commitment publicly. This has been the experience of countries like the US.
Although more than twenty US states currently allow same-sex couples to marry, the remaining thirty
strongly oppose it.
(D No society should abandon its religious, social and moral traditions, however widely they are
debated. The 21st century has witnessed an amazingly rapid change in how we view gender roles and
political participation. Surely, as part of these changes we should consider reducing active
discrimination against people based on their sexuality. That does not mean, however, that we should
actively reward such minorities, by casting away ancient customs and ideas which have stood the test
of time in most corners of the world. [ 10 ]

E9 "Following Ireland, for Better or for Worse"
by Roy G. Biv (2015)
c Same-sex marriage is an idea [ 11 ] time has come. The recent national referendum held in Ireland,
where the citizens overwhelmingly voted "Yes", is one simple proof: if even a Catholic country can
accept it, why should other, less religious countries ignore its many advantages?
c Clearly, same-sex marriage is a civil right. In the US, a 1967 Supreme Court case confirmed that
marriage is "one of the basic civil rights of man," and same-sex marriages should receive the same
protections given to interracial marriages by that decision. The NAACP (National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People), on May 19, 2012, declared same-sex marriage as "one of the key
civil rights struggles of our time." [ 12 ]
(D Marriage has never been simply about one man and one woman. In most societies throughout
history, couples have lived with many other relatives in an extended family. [ A ] societies and
religions permit a man to have many wives, [ B ] there are many instances of community-based
child-rearing around the world. Looked at broadly, heterosexual monogamy [Å\JPffil] can be
considered "unnatural" in evolutionary terms. In fact, nothing is so narrow-minded as to assume that
the modern family is the only way for people to be happy.
@ Extending the definition of marriage will not cause the end of the family. A 2009 study published in
Social Science Quarterly found that "laws permitting same-sex marriage have no adverse effect on
marriage, divorce, and abortion rates, or the percent of children born outside marriage." The
American Anthropological Association (AAA) has also found "no support whatsoever for the view
that civilization depends upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Anthropological
research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-
sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies." Legalizing gay marriage, therefore,
will not harm heterosexual marriages or what right-wing politicians mistakenly call "family values"
[ 14 ].
c In fact, the opposite may be true. Divorce rates even appear to be higher where gay marriage is
banned. Massachusetts, which became the first state to legalize gay marriage in 2004, also had the
lowest divorce rate in the country in 2010. Its divorce rate declined 21% between 2003 and 2010.
Alaska, which altered its constitution to prohibit gay marriage in 1998, saw a 17.2% increase in its
divorce rate. The seven US states with the highest divorce rates between 2005 and 2010 all had legal
prohibitions against gay marriage. [ 15 ]
c Opponents of same-sex marriage usually [ 16 ] the issue of children. Some argue that marriage is
solely for the purpose of having and raising children. But if this is true, how should we treat those
male-female couples who do not have children? No one is proposing that such couples should be
unable to marry, or that having children is a requirement for marriage. People choose marriage for a
wide variety of reasons, and it is not the state's right to deny couples the chance to wed legally.
c Interestingly, some of the same people go [ 17 ] argue that same-sex couples should not be allowed
to raise families and children. On the contrary, society needs parents to raise children in need. In the
US, 100,000 children are waiting to be adopted. R. S. Devon's 2010 study found that children of
lesbian mothers were rated higher than children of heterosexual parents in social and academic skills,
and had fewer social problems. Malls' 2010 paper found that children of gay fathers were "no
different to those adopted by heterosexual parents." As Washington Post journalist Ezra Klein argues,
"We should be encouraging gay couples to adopt children. We should see this as a great gift that gay
marriage could bring to kids who need [ 18 ] two loving parents." Gay marriage would make it
easier for same-sex couples to adopt, and thus provide stable and loving homes for children.
R Marriage [ 19 ] be redefined as society's attitudes evolve. People in most countries long ago chose
to reject the idea that a woman's legal rights and economic identity should be taken over by her
husband upon marriage. In the 21st century people have no problem with marriage between people of
different races. Today, many states also allow quick divorces. Time passes, attitudes change, and
societies evolve; laws ought to reflect those developments. At present, polls show that a majority of
citizens in places as different as South Africa, Germany and Brazil all support gay marriage. It is time
for our ideas about marriage to evolve once again. [ 20 ]

R Death and taxes, according to the English author Daniel Defoe, are the most certain things in life.
Death is, alas, inescapable. Taxation, however, seems dependent on our contract with the state. We
pay taxes because the state provides services to us. But how far does this contract extend? Do
citizens have duties beyond paying taxes as well as rights? For example, can the state oblige its
citizens to vote in elections?
(D Compulsory voting is hardly a new issue. Wealthy adult male citizens of ancient Athens, [ 21 ],
were obliged to do so. In 1777, the US state of Georgia briefly had a similar requirement, and
Switzerland introduced the system in 1904. The idea was simple: voting was a duty, not a right, and
the process of choosing a government needed to involve all those who could vote, to ensure the
legitimacy [JESti] of the state.
(D Today, compulsory voting [ 22 ] considerable discussion. The number of people choosing to vote in
many countries has been declining for 50 years. In others, though occasional elections have seen brief
surges of political interest, the overall trend has been to withdraw from politics in general. The results
are plain to see: lacking clear popular support, governments have been unable to carry out needed
reforms, and political gridlock [fr V ! has become common. Indeed, in some countries,
the legitimacy of the electoral system itself has been questioned. Since the economic health of many
of these countries remains rather fragile, this is a serious matter.
@ Is compulsory voting, however, necessarily limited to rich countries? Some evidence suggests that
compulsory voting can only follow economic development. Even though voting is actually enforced in
only 10 of the 22 nations where it is legally required, all of those 10 countries are relatively rich. At
first glance then, punishing a failure to vote with a fine might seem impractical for poor countries.
Interestingly, however, compulsory voting is not restricted to rich countries. In South America, for

example, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru and Ecuador all enforce laws requiring citizens to vote.
These nations, despite recent rapid growth, are still developing countries. [ 23 ]
(D Compulsory voting seems attractive for three main reasons. Firstly, it increases the legitimacy of any
government. Since everyone voted (or as close as one could ensure), questioning the result seems
unreasonable. [ 24 ], making everyone vote might remove barriers which often prevent some
disadvantaged sections of society from having a voice. [ 25 ], in some places, it is in the governing
party's interest to keep hostile voter groups from voting: under compulsory voting systems,
governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has the chance to vote. Finally, compulsory voting
can prevent extreme political parties from gaining power, since they can only do this when ordinary
citizens are too lazy or fearful to vote. States might actually benefit from increased citizen
participation; since all must vote, the level of interest in and appreciation of politics is often higher.
c In order to demonstrate all this, the best example would be Australia. According to a law passed in
1924, citizens aged 18 and above are required to vote in both federal and state elections. Voters must
place a voting paper in the ballot box, but beyond that no rule exists. So in each election a certain
number of papers are blank or spoiled. Nevertheless, over the course of 19 elections between 1960
and 1995, at 81%, the average voting rate was remarkably high. Political stability has been
maintained despite a large number of elections, and its democracy remains vigorous.
c Political systems, however, are rarely problem-free; and compulsory voting is no exception. To
begin with, compulsory voting is no solution to problems of voter fraud and registration issues.
Furthermore, the requirement to have an opinion might not be consistent with the basic human right
to free speech. Is forcing people to choose fair, if they prefer silence? However, advocates of required
voting might argue, citing the Australian example, that one is still free to post a blank ballot, and thus
to express no opinion.
(D Another problem [ 26 ] making ignorant or uninterested voters vote. Should such people really be
allowed to influence the results when they clearly neither understand nor care about the issues at
hand? Depending on the electoral system, this might be a serious problem. For example, extreme
candidates might end up winning, simply because many voters just filled in the first box available.
Such an outcome was actually observed once in Australia, where an automobile enthusiast was elected
after thousands of votes unexpectedly went his way. [ 27 ]
R Nonetheless, compulsory voting seems likely to be an advantageous system, as long as people see so
few rewards for voting. At present, few countries can better illustrate the difficulty of finding a
workable balance between the burdens and rewards of voting than North Korea. Voting there is
compulsory, but only one candidate's name is on the list. This is a clear case of no reward, but a high
risk of punishment for not voting. In general, however, if people voted out of enthusiasm (perhaps
motivated by rewards the state might offer either in cash or tax reduction), we would not need to
make them vote. But until such a scheme is created, it may be best to make voting a duty, in order to
make governments more legitimate and citizens more aware.

Twenty three years ago, my wife and I were having an argument about how to celebrate our first
anniversary. Money was tight, and we had to choose between taking a beach vacation or buying a
couch, which we did not have. Being Spanish, she cheerfully supported the beach. As a thrifty American,
I argued for the couch because it was permanent. In the end, we compromised Å\ we went to the beach.
Vacations say a lot about people. For one thing, where people choose to go indicates how much they
like to be around others. In an article published in the Journal of Research in Personality, psychologists
asked college students about their geographical preferences and found that shy and inward-looking
people ("introverts") preferred the mountains, while outgoing and sociable people ("extroverts")
preferred the ocean. The researchers found more evidence for this when they looked at who lived
where: Residents of especially mountainous areas were, on average, more introverted than those who
lived in flatter places. The finding is fairly intuitive. In the mountains one easily finds separation and
isolation. Meanwhile, beaches tend to be crowded places full of half-dressed strangers, a potentially
unappealing scene for introverts, but exactly the point for extroverts.
There's a surprising amount of research on vacations and what aspects are satisfying. To begin with,
vacation planning tends to bring happiness. Data show that people actually derive most happiness from
a vacation in the planning phase. On its own, this finding would seem to recommend the creation of a
complex schedule, rather than a spontaneous getaway. But if complex trips bring joy in the planning,
eXtt2017ÅíB*Å_AiilfflSiEJB •
JÅòi*(iÅò)

they risk giving almost no happiness in the taking. Harvard Business Review reports that people get
little to no happiness boost from vacations they consider stressful. Crowded schedules and tight
connections may look exciting in the process of planning, but they suggest you return no happier than
when you left. Only people with simple, relaxed trips seem to get a happiness boost. Think of this as
the Vacation Paradox: You have to choose between being happy beforehand or happy afterward. Sorry.
Whether people take a vacation at all says a bit about career success, but the relationship is opposite
from what one might imagine. According to a study from the U.S. Travel Association, American workers
in 2013 gave up 169 million days of paid time off, worth $52.4 billion. Was there a career benefit to
giving up so much vacation time? There was not, according to the study. Those who left between 11
and 15 vacation days unused tended to receive smaller raises or bonuses than those who used all their
vacation days. We don't know if this is because the vacation-less employees were overstressed, or
because incompetent employees who couldn't get their work done skipped vacation. But the finding
does indicate that vacation takers are not paying a career penalty.
Vacations also say a thing or two about one's country of origin. In America, the opening conversation
topic with a stranger is frequently, "What do you do for a living?" For Europeans, the customary topic is
"Where are you going on vacation this year?" Everyone has an answer, usually involving weeks and
weeks at the beach or the mountains. The data provide support for the saying that Americans live to
work, while Europeans work to live. The average American worker is offered just 16 days of paid
holiday each year and has no legal guarantee to any time off. Compare this to Italy (31 days), Spain (34
days) and Portugal (35 days).
You might be skeptical about these statistics, noting, for instance, Spain's 23 percent unemployment
rate. But having lived in Spain for years, I can assure you that calling attention to the relationship
between voluntary and involuntary idleness, namely unemployment, elicits reactions that run from
confusion to dismissal. So just keep it to yourself, and get back to work.
Finally, for kids, summer vacation has a surprising effect on school performance. In 1996, researchers
found that the average student loses a month of academic progress during summer vacation, with the
biggest impact on poor kids, who lost significantly more reading ability than those from middle-income
families. Obviously there are other goals for the summer, but you have to ask whether our century-old
summer vacation system is really serving students as well as it could.
So what does your vacation say about you? Personally, I've made my peace with vacations, so we're
going away this year Å\ but we're not taking a Spanish month; just a modest American 10 days. Lacking
a consensus on whether we like people or not, we will go to both the mountains and the beach. And
when we return, the kids Å\ slightly less literate Å\ will park themselves on the couch we finally bought.

mm Over the years, you have probably heard about how the brain works. You may have taken a
course or read a book that promised to reveal the secret of maximizing mental capacity Å\ a common
sales pitch of leadership coaches these days. In the process, you may have read that after a critical
period in childhood there is not much significant learning, or that a large part of your brain is inactive at
any given time, or that you're capable of learning effectively only in your preferred style. Each of these
claims is what we call a "neuro-myth," a misconception based on an incorrect interpretation of scientific
research. Our experience suggests that such misunderstandings remain rooted in many corporate
training programs. As companies pour money into developing employees, they cannot afford to invest in
training programs based on inaccurate assumptions. In recent years, for example, U.S. businesses have
spent more than $164 billion annually on employee learning. The stakes are high and getting higher.
Bridging the gap between popular neuro-myths and scientific evidence gathered in the past two decades
is a growing challenge. Unless these misconceptions are addressed, they will continue to undermine
organizational learning efforts. In this article, we discuss the three most prominent neuro-myths in light
of the latest research and explore some of the implications.
Myth #1: Most of us have heard about the critical learning period, the early years of life when the vast
majority of the brain's development is thought to occur. After this period, according to the assumption,
human development is more or less fixed. That interpretation, however, is an exaggeration. Recent
research indicates that experience changes both the brain's physical structure and its functional
organization Å\ a phenomenon described as neuro-plasticity or mental flexibility. In this regard,
researchers studying the brain are increasingly interested in meditation. Practicing simple mindfulness
techniques, such as concentrated breathing, helps build denser gray matter in parts of the brain
associated with learning, memory, and emotion. A team led by Harvard scientists has shown that just
eight weeks of meditation produces structural brain changes significant enough to be picked up by MRI
brain imaging scanners.
Organizations from General Mills in consumer foods to digital giants Facebook and Google give
employees opportunities to benefit from meditation. Most programs have gained enthusiastic support
from workers, who often see a marked improvement in mind-set and job performance. For example,
employees at the health insurance company Aetna who have participated in the company's free yoga
classes reported, on average, a 28 percent decrease in stress and a productivity increase of 62 minutes a
week Å\ an added value of approximately $3,000 per employee per year. CEO Mark Bertolini, who
started the program, is surprised at the level of interest; to date, more than a quarter of Aetna's 50,000
employees have taken at least one class. Leaders like Bertolini understand that providing employees
with tools to become more focused creates a better working environment conducive to high
performance.
Myth #2: A recent European survey discovered that nearly 50 percent of teachers surveyed accept the
idle brain theory, a belief that large parts of the brain are unused at any given moment. However, recent
studies have shown that, regardless of what a person is doing, the entire brain is generally active. The
implication is that people learn new ideas and skills, not by tapping into unused parts of the brain, but
by forming stronger connections between already existing associations. This view of brain capacity is
particularly relevant for the environment in which learning occurs. Everybody is well aware of the habit
of quickly checking e-mail messages in the middle of a meeting. The problem is that such multitasking
engages large parts of the brain's working memory. Without freeing that up, we cannot successfully learn
new information. In short, multitasking and learning do not occur effectively at the same time.

Recognizing the problem, some organizations are working to build comprehensive learning environments
where distractions are eliminated. At McKinsey, we've created a model factory that participants walk
through to see operations in action. First, however, everyone is asked to place their cell phones in a
locker, so they can fully concentrate on the activity at hand. At some companies, removing the
temptation of using mobile devices during training sessions is becoming commonplace.
Myth #3: Almost everyone has encountered the theory that people are either analytic (left brained) or
creative (right brained). However, this divided notion is false. The two hemispheres of the brain are
linked and communicate extensively; they do not work independently. The simplistic notion of a binary
brain has led to the misconception that everyone has a preferred learning style. Recent studies have
flatly disproved this, suggesting instead that engaging all the senses in a variety of ways helps people
retain new content. One organization that puts the idea into practice is KFC, which uses multiple forms
of learning (audio, visual, and performative) in customer service. Employee-training sessions include
simulations that place a store worker in the role of the customer, along with video game-like activities
where employees respond to typical cues of satisfaction. At the end of a session, employees report on
what they've learned, after which they receive feedback and coaching.
Although significant progress has been made, much remains to be done to eliminate neuro-myths from
corporate training programs. Neuro-science has confirmed some approaches that professionals already
use, but it has contradicted others. Companies need to draw on these findings and rethink their training
programs accordingly. At the very least, they should improve their dialogue with the scientific community.

U Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s most consideration of living sustainably was focused on the
environmental and economic dimensions, there has been increased attention since 2000 on the social
dimensions; that is, on the ways in which democracy, social justice, well-being, and poverty relate to
economics and the environment. "Sustainists" contend that a sustainable society preserves natural
capital, eliminates waste, and establishes economic stability; at the same time, it promotes human
happiness, equality, and well-being. This emphasis on human welfare is one of the central features that
distinguishes the sustainability movement from classic environmentalism. For sustainists, faulty
economic systems and environmental destruction are always linked to social problems.
What is social sustainability? Richard Stren and Mario Polese define it as "policies and institutions
that have the overall effect of integrating diverse groups in a just and equitable fashion." Jonathan
Harris and Neva Goodwin offer a similar interpretation: "The social dimension of sustainability may be
defined as progress toward enabling all human beings to satisfy essential needs, to achieve a reasonable
level of comfort, to live lives of meaning and interest, and to have access to health care and
opportunities for education."
By contrast, a socially unsustainable society is characterized by extreme poverty and/or an inability for
citizens to live safe, meaningful, and satisfying lives. I (t7) I an unjust and unhappy society somehow
managed to live within its ecological limits, social unsustainability would inevitably lead to socio-political
unrest and even revolution. A stable society therefore requires justice, equality, democratic institutions,
and the conditions for life satisfaction. For Harris and Goodwin, "a socially sustainable system must
achieve fairness in distribution and opportunity, adequate provision for social services, including health
and education, gender equity, and political participation."
Much of the focus of social sustainability has been on getting rid of poverty in the developing world.
Sustainable development is currently being rethought in a way that balances the three Es (environment,
economy, equity) to benefit the poor, works with local needs, and promotes equality while encouraging
environmentally responsible practices. In the past, many top-down development initiatives intended to
help poorer societies have made I (is) I. either socially or environmentally. There are a number of
examples, such as the International Monetary Fund's role in worsening the food crisis in Malawi, in
which IMF policies restricted farmers' access to vital agricultural materials, and eliminated consumer
subsidies and food price stabilization.
Herman Daly has argued that the central problem with the development policies of the UN, IMF, and
World Bank in the 1990s was that they reproduced in poorer countries the same economic mistakes
made by the industrialized world. Instead of focusing on the developing world, attention was given to
how industrial countries could grow and profit from development policies. Moreover, local
circumstances were often ignored by distant bureaucrats with ideas that looked good on paper. As a
result, according to Harris and Goodwin, "the benefits of development have been distributed unevenly,
with income inequalities remaining persistent, and sometimes increasing over time."

VS (37) Prior to the 18th century, wild places such as mountains and forests were seen as hostile,
frightening, and of no use unless mined or cut down. The Romantics took a different view. Poets such
as Wordsworth saw humans as part of nature, not in opposition to it, and even depicted nature as a
kind of moral teacher. The Romantics' attitude was largely an artistic reaction to the Industrial
Revolution, which radically transformed both social and natural landscapes.
Which one of the following does the passage imply? The answer is: I &f) I.
1 A Romantic literary sensitivity entails skepticism about the exploitation of nature
2 The desire to dominate nature in the name of progress disappeared with the Romantics
3 The Romantics reluctantly accepted the positive consequences of industrialization
4 Romantic literature has no potential to reorient attitudes toward the natural world

privileged position compared to blue-collar workers. Today, however, it is often people in skilled
trades who find reasonable hours coupled with good pay, whereas professionals are subjected to
intense pressure in the global market and forced to work long hours to survive.
Which one of the following does the passage imply? The answer is: I I.
1 Skilled blue-collar workers have fallen behind in the American economy today
2 People who work with their hands are more talented than white-collar workers
3 International companies are beginning to hire more employees in skilled trades
4 Worldwide competition has put severe demands on professionals in business
(39) Attempts to explain daily stock movements are foolish. A survey of the 1987 stock crash found no
evidence that any news story or rumor was responsible for investor behavior. And the stock market is
a terrible guide to the economic future: Paul Samuelson once commented ironically that the market
had predicted nine of the last five recessions, and nothing has changed on that front.
Which one of the following does the passage imply? The answer is: I 69) I.
1 Effective economic policy is based on careful reasoning, not the stock market
2 Many economists only reluctantly predict fluctuations in the stock market
3 Investor behavior is profoundly influenced by rumor and speculation
4 The 1987 stock crash was the first of the last nine recessions to take place
M Nationalism is a political ideology that stresses the superiority of the nation. It emphasizes the
primacy of national identity based on such factors as ethnicity, language, and cultural tradition. Even
the arts have sometimes played a role in nationalism, and its core appeal has always been more
emotional than rational. The nation is held up as a sort of sacred entity, greater than the sum of the
individuals within it.
Which one of the following does the passage NOT imply? The answer is: I M I.
1 Nationalism has put the values of a nation as a whole before personal rights
2 Nationalists are often critical of people from other social and cultural backgrounds
3 Artists have prevented nationalist politicians from leading countries into dictatorship
4 People who are globally minded distance themselves from the ideology of nationalism

The conservation of energy would let us think that we have as much energy as we want. Nature
never loses or gains energy. ( <h ) the energy of the sea, for example, the ^thermal motion of all the
atoms in the sea, is practically unavailable to us. In order to get that energy organized, herded, to make
it available for use, we have to have a difference in temperature, or else we shall find that although the
energy is there we cannot make use of it. There is a great difference between energy and ( 1 ) of
energy. The energy of the sea is a large amount, but we cannot harness it.
The conservation of energy means that the total energy in the world is kept the same. But in the
irregular jigglings that energy can be spread about so uniformly that, in certain circumstances, there is no
way to make more go one way than the other Å\ there is no way to control it any more.
I think that by an ^analogy I can give some idea of the difficulty, in this way. I do not know if you
have ever had the experience Å\Å° I have Å\ of sitting on the beach with several towels, and suddenly a
tremendous ( 2 ) comes. You pick up the towels as quickly as you can, and run into the bathhouse.
( v> ) you start to dry yourself, and you find that this towel is a little wet, but it is drier than you are.
You keep drying with this one until you find it is too wet Å\ it is wetting you as much as drying you Å\
and you try another one; and pretty soon you discover a horrible thing Å\ that all the towels are @damp
and so are you. There is no way to get any drier, even though you have many towels, because there is
no difference in some sense between the wetness of the towels and the wetness of yourself. I could
invent a kind of quantity which I could call 'ease of removing water'. The towel has the same ease of
removing water from it as you have, so when you touch yourself with the towel, as much water comes
off the towel on to you as comes from you to the towel. It does not mean there is the same amount of
water in the towel as there is on you Å\ ( X ) it Å\ but they have the same dampness. When things get
to the same dampness then there is nothing you can do any longer.
Now the water is like the energy, because the ( 3 ) amount of water is not changing. (If the
bathhouse door is open and you can run into the sun and get dried out, or find another towel, then
you're saved, but suppose everything is closed, and you can't get away from these towels or get any new
towels.) In the same way if you imagine a part of the world that is closed, and wait long enough, in the
accidents of the world the energy, like the water, will be ^distributed over all of the parts ( 4 ) until
there is nothing left of one-way-ness, nothing left of the real interest of the world as we experience it.

K9 It is often said that our understanding and knowledge of death separates the human animal from
all other animals. We alone know that we will die Å\ that one day, suddenly or slowly, our life, our
loves, our dreams will I (&) I. Our greatest art, music, and literature, as well as acts of religion and
morality, are all inspired by this awareness. Perhaps we are the only animals with foreknowledge of
death, but when it comes to grieving, scientists have observed that we are not so unique.
The study of animal grief is a young field, largely because studies of any animal behaviors that one
might think of as "human" were ignored for much of the twentieth century. It was commonly held that
nonhuman animals were only reactive beings, lacking thoughts and emotions, and responding to stimuli
as unthinking, unfeeling robots. Scientists were cautioned about being anthropomorphic, that is,
regarding animals as they are often depicted in naive films and storybooks Å\ as if they were F M I
dressed up in fur or feathers. Researchers who thought they detected animal emotions Å\ especially
those that we think of as uniquely human, such as love, joy, or grief Å\ were considered to be
sentimentalists. In the last few decades, though, wildlife biologists have ^amassed so many firsthand
accounts of animals caring for and mourning their dead that the idea of animal grief is no longer as
suspect as it once was.
Scientists ^grappling with animal grief must find some way of framing their questions into hypotheses
they can test. So far, none of them have figured out how to set up an experiment to address the big
question of whether or how animals understand death. But they are getting closer to answering what
once seemed an equally daunting problem: why do animals grieve? There are enough examples of grief
in species as varied as goats, baboons, and gorillas that the emotion may be an experience shared by
many species. If so, then it must have an evolutionary history and confer some benefit Å\ that is, it must
be I (?) I in some way, enabling the mourner to survive long enough to reproduce and pass his or her
genes to the next generation. Otherwise, natural selection would have ^weeded out grief long ago.
From a study of twenty-two wild-baboon females who had lost either an infant or other close relative
to a predator, scientists know that the animals' stress hormones @flare for four weeks after the attack.
They typically act in a "bereaved" manner, too, the researchers say, sitting apart from other baboons and
not seeking out grooming (a behavior that has both social and hygienic benefits). In time, the baboons'
stress hormones I 00 I. and they again spend time with their fellows. At first glance, it would seem that
grieving would leave baboons Å\ or other mourning animals Å\ at great risk of either falling ill or being
taken by a predator themselves. But another study, by neuroscientists Karen Wager-Smith and Athina
Markou, suggests that the mourning period is actually a neurobiological necessity, particularly for any
animal that forms close bonds with another individual. The researchers note that stress can inflict
"microdamage" in key areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, both of which
are concerned with memory, emotions, personality, and planning. But the brain is not a static organ; it
responds dynamically to life's events by pruning away neurons that are no longer needed and ^sprouting
new ones. Rewiring takes time and energy, and so a period of mourning Å\ of sleeping longer,
minimizing social contact, eating less Å\ can ultimately prove beneficial. And, indeed, all of the baboons
eventually recovered from their grief, made new friends, or gave birth to new children. Grief for them
can have an "adaptive value," as evolutionary biologists are fond of saying; it enables an animal to
recover from what is essentially minor brain trauma and carry on with the purpose of life Å\ reproducing.

The passage opens with a common (7) about a major difference between humans and other animals; in
short, humans know that they will die. But as the paragraph goes on to explain, perhaps many animals
are more capable of grief than we have given them W) for. The second paragraph looks at the (Å°Å‚ that
stopped scientists from looking at animal grief through much of the twentieth century. The third
paragraph examines the struggles scientists have faced trying to form hypotheses to explore these
questions and offers examples of some of the animals in which grief has been M. Given these
examples, the paragraph concludes, grief must have some kind of adaptive value; otherwise, why
would evolution have allowed it to W? As is explained in the final paragraph, the authors of one study
looking at wild baboons suggest that a period of grief is useful for (*) the brain; a baboon that
temporarily W out from social interaction can eventually recover from trauma and get back to the

EV The following dialogue involves a Japanese teacher talking to her foreign students about the idea
Bd of omotenashi. Read the dialogue and answer the questions which follow.
Teacher: Christel Takigawa really ^rnade a splash with her omotenashi speech. But what do you think
omotenashi even means?
Jamal: In English, I think the best translation would be hospitality.
Teacher: (7), but is the idea of good hospitality the same in every country and culture?
David: tf). For example, in my country, I think good hospitality implies friendliness. Service with a
smile, ?so to speak. People like to make ^small talk when they're serving you, but that
doesn't happen as much in Japan. But I don't think that means people in Japan are being
inhospitable. It just reflects different cultural values.
Teacher: (f), David. Clearly culture is going to shape how we interpret actions.
Ashley: Sometimes I find the formality of Japanese hospitality a bit ^off-putting. If a friend comes to
my house, I usually tell them to make themselves at home, and I really mean it. It's not just
for them, either. It's for me, too. I don't want to have to run around after them all day. M?

improvements in transportation, including a reduction in car accidents, more efficient transportation, and
an increase in road q (c ). There are, however, many hurdles to successfully implementing the
driverless car as a common and effective method of transportation. This is especially true in situations in
which a driverless car would need to

To be useful, a driverless car must be able to go to a given destination based on passenger-provided

1 In 1962, one observer believed that America was on the brink of a spiritual breakthrough. But
that's not how things have turned out. What a joy it would be to show the America of 2015 to
Edward T. Chase.
2 Chase, the author of a 1962 Atlantic essay titled "Money Isn't Everything," was positively
[1] (1. realistic 2. demanding 3. euphoric) as he observed the cultural changes of the post-war
period. "It is my belief," he wrote, "that in fact we in the United States are evolving beyond the
'consumption society' Å\ one that has mastered the problems of production Å\ and are approaching a
new order of society, the society of self-realization." Via the alchemy of mass prosperity combined
with mass education, Americans, Chase explained, were losing their narrow-minded focus on material
success, and were instead developing an appreciation for culture, conservation, and jobs that provided
"self-fulfillment" [2](1. against 2. over 3. under) financial remuneration.
3 His evidence: a massive increase in spending on "culture," a doubling in how much Americans spent
on books between 1955 and 1961, an increase of 29 percent in library-book circulation over a five-
year period, a boom in paperback sales, an explosion in the number of museums and in museum
attendance, a rise in a desire to pursue "intrinsically important work," and on and on.
4 Man, if this guy could see today.
5 By one measure, "arts and cultural production" today [3](1. accounts 2. compensates 3. makes
up) for 4.3 percent of GDP, or nearly $700 billion. Many, many more Americans read books today
than did at mid-century (and young people are reading more than their parents and grandparents did).
There are now some 35,000 museums across the country, The Washington Post reports. Museum
exa 2017 Åí!Å}^AtÅíF0'MIEÅ‚ @
i*
-148-
attendance is huge. According to the American Alliance of Museums, "there are approximately 850
million visits each year to American museums, more than the attendance for all major-league sporting
events and theme parks [4](1. accompanied 2. accumulated 3. combined)." Both the number and
percentage of Americans who have graduated from college continue to rise.
6 And then there's the Internet. Chase would have been shocked by the Internet. Essentially free
access to all the world's information from a device two-thirds of Americans have in their pockets.
7 And yet, [5] (1. optimism 2. pessimism 3. consumerism) like Edward T. Chase's occupies little
territory in the landscape of today's sentiments, in which cynicism, contempt, and indifference tend to
[6](1. dissipate 2. diverge 3. dominate).
8 Perhaps this is because Chase was wrong. A half-century of cultural edification has passed, and this
country is still [7] (1. accompanied 2. preoccupied 3. sprinkled) with money and material accumulation.
Even the wealthiest are working more hours than they were three decades ago Å\ the very people who
are at financial liberty to ease up on work a bit and [8](1. dissociate from 2. do away with
3. indulge in) some of the nonmaterial consumption Chase idealized. Consumption, not culture, has
triumphed as though the two were ever separate phenomena to begin with.
9 It's not only that. America's gloomy national mood is a reasonable response to very real and very
deep problems. [9](1. Because of 2. Despite 3. Thanks to) the country's prosperity and astonishing
technological advances, wages have stagnated, segregation endures, women still [10] (1. lag behind
2. linger on 3. tag along) professionally, and the climate has been dangerously destabilized. There's
no need to continue this list when anv perusal of a newspaper will suffice. Unmitigated optimism
today is the song of the naive.
10 But a bit of singing is nevertheless warranted. Because for all its troubles, the world today is still a
marvel Å\ one that's all too easily taken for granted.
Å\ Based on Rosen, R.J. (2015. Julv 24). The triumph of consumerism. The Atlantic.
[11] What is meant by the term "a new order of society" as used in the 2nd paragraph?
1
A society in which people place top priority on material success and accumulation of wealth.
A society in which people are more concerned with self-realization and self-fulfillment.
A society in which people focus on financial remuneration more than anything else.
4. A society in which people enjoy not only mass prosperity but also mass education.
[12] Which of the following best represents the author's view on a "half-century of cultural edification"
as mentioned in the 8th paragraph?
1. Cultural edification would have been impossible without the promotion of higher education.
2. As envisioned by Chase, the increase in cultural edification has contributed to a decrease in
consumerism.
3. Despite the fact that people have easy access to a variety of cultural opportunities, it does not
seem to have eradicated materialism.
4. The Internet has made the greatest contribution to cultural edification by making possible free
access to the world's information.
[13] In the 8th paragraph, the author states "the wealthiest are working more hours than they were three
decades ago" in order to show that
1. cultural edification has had a great impact on the majority of less wealthy people, but not on the
most wealthy.
2. the wealthiest people are invariably hard-working; thus, they are entitled to enjoy nonmaterial
consumption.
3. even the wealthiest cannot sustain their cultural activities unless they work more hours than
before.
4. money and material accumulation remain an important concern even for those who are already
wealthy.
[14] Which of the following best represents the author's view on today's America?
1. It is futile to dwell on the problems of today; instead, people should learn to have unmitigated
optimism.
2. The country is faced with a number of serious problems, yet we shouldn't be all that pessimistic
about the present situation.
3. The country is entrenched with all sorts of devastating problems, so much so that people cannot
see a bright future ahead of them.
4. The country is enjoying a high level of prosperity and technological advances, which will
eventually eradicate many of the problems faced today.
[15] From this article, we can assume that the author
1. seems to be amused by the fact that Chase's 1962 essay failed to predict the American society of
today.

strive for in as early as 1962.
3. tries to maintain as neutral and impersonal a position as possible in order to be objective in his

1 Researchers all over the world have been trying to measure happiness for decades. They have
conducted surveys partly to determine what makes people happy and partly to gauge social progress.
One of the things these surveys tell us is that, not surprisingly, people in rich countries are happier
than people in poor countries. [16](1. Alternatively 2. Obviously 3. Unexpectedly), money
matters. But these surveys also reveal that money doesn't matter as much as you might think. Once a
society's level of per capita wealth crosses a [17] (1. hedge 2. mark 3. threshold) from poverty to
adequate subsistence, further increases in national wealth have almost no effect on happiness. You
find as many happy people in Poland as in Japan, for example, even though the average Japanese is
almost ten times richer than the average Pole.
2 If we look at happiness within a nation at different times, we find the same story. In the last forty
years, the per capita income of Americans has more than doubled. The percentage of homes with
dishwashers has increased from 9 percent to 50 percent. The percentage of homes with air-
conditioning has increased from 15 percent to 73 percent. But this does not mean we have more
happy people. Even more [18](1. comforting 2. devastating 3. striking), in Japan, per capita wealth
has increased by a factor of five in the last forty years, again with no measurable increase in the level
of individual happiness.
3 But if money doesn't do it for people, what does? What seems to be the most important factor in
[158(1. adopting 2. eliminating 3. promoting) happiness is close social relations. People who are
married, who have good friends, and who are close to their families are happier than those who are
not. Being connected to others seems to be much more important to subjective well-being than being
rich. But a word of caution is [20] (1. at stake 2. in order 3. on demand). We know with certainty
that there is a relationship between being able to connect socially and being happy. It is less clear,
however, which is the cause and which is the effect. Miserable people are surely less likely than happy
people to have close friends, devoted family, and [21] (1. endangered 2. enduring 3. entrusted)
marriages. So it is possible that happiness comes first and close relations come second. What seems
likely to me is that the causality works both ways: happy people attract others to them, and being with
others makes Deode haDDv.
4 What's puzzling here is that close social ties actually decrease freedom, choice, and autonomy, which
presumably [22] (1. constitute 2. recognize 3. reorganize) important elements for happiness. For
example, to be someone's friend is to undertake weighty responsibilities that may limit your own
freedom. So, what seems to contribute most to happiness binds us rather than liberates us. Obviously,
it is [23] (1. imperative 2. justifiable 3. naive) to maintain that freedom of choice automatically leads
to happiness.
5 Political scientist Robert Lane maintains that the growth of material affluence has not brought with it
an increase in subjective well-being. He points out that we are experiencing a significant decrease in
well-being as [24] (1. enforced 2. evidenced 3. triggered) by the fact that the rate of clinical
depression has more than tripled over the last two generations. According to Lane, we are achieving
increased affluence and increased freedom [25](1. at the sacrifice of 2. in addition to 3. under the
guise of) social relations. We earn more and spend more, but we spend less time with others. And
this adds to our burden of choice. As Lane writes: "What was once given by neighborhood and work
now must be achieved; people have had to make their own friends...and actively cultivate their own
family connections." In other words, our social fabric is no longer a birthright but has become a series
of deliberate and demanding choices.
Å\ Based on Schwartz, B. (2004). The paradox of choice. New York: HarperCollins Publishers Inc.
[26] According to the article, which of the following is true?
1. The level of material affluence has no impact on the level of subjective well-being.
2. People can attain a high level of subjective well-being if they learn to live a frugal life.
3. People's sense of well-being is determined by the level of national wealth only to a certain extent.
4. As a society's level of per capita wealth increases, people's sense of well-being increases
proportionately.
[27] The author makes reference to the Polish and the Japanese in the 1st paragraph in order to show that
1. the level of national wealth of Poland is significantly lower than that of Japan.

2. the level of national wealth of Poland is just about the same as that of Japan.
3. further economic development will result in increased happiness.
4. the level of national wealth is not a clear indicator of happiness.
[28] According to the article, which of the following is true?
1. Poor people tend to form fewer social ties than society's more affluent people.
2. It has been proven that happiness brings about close social ties.
3. It is assumed that close social ties are the main cause of happiness.
4. There is some relationship between close social connection and personal well-being.
[29] According to the 4th and 5th paragraphs, which of the following is true?
1. Having to make many choices can be a burden, which may contribute to decreased subjective
well-being.
2. The best way to cope with an increase in the rate of clinical depression is to allow people more
freedom of choice.
3. Having unlimited freedom of choice, rather than the growth of material affluence, tends to
promote subjective well-being.
4. The growth of material affluence is responsible for a rapid increase in the rate of clinical
depression.
[30] What does Robert Lane mean when he states that "our social fabric is no longer a birthright", as
mentioned in the 5th paragraph?
1. We cannot take it for granted that modern society will provide us with social ties that support us.
2. The basic structure of our society is such that we cannot take it for granted that we are born with
human rights.
3. Our society no longer provides us with our basic needs like food, clothes, and shelter.
4. Our society does not allow us to enjoy happiness and prosperity which should be guaranteed as an
important part of our birthright.

1 Is garbage collection different from other public services? To answer this question, let us consider a
simple hypothetical situation. Suppose a city agreed to provide its residents with all the food they
wished to consume, prepared in the manner they specified, and delivered to their homes for a flat,
monthly fee that was independent of what or how much they ate. What are the likely consequences of
this city food-delivery service? Most likely, people in the city would begin to eat more, because the
size of their food bill would be independent of the amount they ate. They would also be more likely
to consume lobster and filet mignon rather than fish sticks and hamburger because, [61] (1. again
2. already 3. yet), the cost to them would be independent of their menu selections. Soon the city's
budget would be astronomical, and either the monthly fee or taxes would have to be increased.
People from other communities might even begin moving to the city just to partake of this wonderful
service. Within a short time, the city would face a food crisis as it [62](1. turned to 2. managed to
3. sought to) cope with providing an ever-increasing amount of food from a city budget that can no
longer handle the financial burden.
2 If this story sounds [63] (1. realistic 2. silly 3. urgent) to you, just change "food delivery" to
"garbage pickup;" what we have just described is the way most cities in the U.S. have historically
operated their municipal garbage-collection services. The result during the 1990s was the appearance
of a garbage crisis, with overflowing landfills, homeless garbage barges, and drinking water wells said
to be polluted with the [641(1. runaway 2. rundown 3. runoff) from trash heaps. This seeming
crisis Å\ to the extent it existed Å\ was fundamentally no different from the food crisis just described.
The problem was not that almost nobody wants garbage or that garbage can have adverse
environmental effects, [65] (1. in case 2. or even that 3. so that) we had too much garbage. The
problem lay in that we often do not put prices on garbage in the way we put prices on the goods that
generate the garbage.
3 Landfills are considered the final resting place for most of our garbage, [66] (1. although 2. as long
as 3. because) incineration is also widely used in some areas, particularly in the Northeast, where
land values are high. Both methods began [67](1. falling 2. getting 3. taking) out of favor with
people who lived near these facilities, as NIMBY ("not in my backyard") attitudes spread across the
land. Federal, state, and local regulations also made it increasingly difficult to establish new waste
disposal facilities or even to keep old ones [68] (1 .off 2. operating 3. out). Environmental concerns
forced the closure of many landfills throughout the country and prevented others from ever beginning
operations.

4 To reduce the need for waste disposal, [69] (1. carrying 2. holding 3. pushing) recycling became a
major campaign. For a while, it seemed that recycling was going to take care of what appeared to be a
worsening trash problem. In 1987, for example, old newspapers were selling for as much as $100 per
ton, and many municipalities felt that the answer to their financial woes and garbage troubles was at
hand. Yet as more communities began putting mandatory recycling laws into [70] (1. a frame 2. effect
3. words), the prices for recycled trash began to plummet. Over the next five years, 3,500
communities in more than half the states had some form of mandatory residential recycling; the
resulting increase in the supply of used newsprint meant that communities were soon having to pay to
have the stuff [71] (1. carted 2. given 3. kept) away. For glass, the story is much the same. The
market value of the used material is [72] (1. above 2. below 3. between) the cost of collecting and
sorting it. Numerous states have acted to increase the demand for old newsprint by requiring locally
published newspapers to have a minimum content of recycled newsprint. Because of these
[73](1. mandates 2. materials 3. values), the recycling rate for newsprint has doubled over the past
twenty years, but the current rate of 70 percent is thought by many experts to be about the practical
maximum.
5 Recycling raises significant issues that were often ignored during the early rush to embrace the
concept. For example, the production of 100 tons of de-inked fiber from old newsprint produced
about 40 tons of sludge that must be disposed of somehow. Although the total volume of material is
reduced, the [74] (1. concentrated 2. dissipated 3. evaporated) form of what is left can make it more
costly to dispose of properly. Similarly, recycling paper is unlikely to save trees, for most virgin
newsprint (newsprint made from raw wood) is made from trees planted expressly for that purpose and
harvested as a crop; if recycling increases, many of these trees simply will not be planted. Moreover,
most virgin newsprint is made in Canada, using clean hydroelectric power. Makers of newsprint in the
United States often use [75] (1. eco-friendly 2. higher-polluting 3. profit-making) energy such as
coal. Thus one potential negative side effect of recycling is the switch from hydroelectric power to
fossil fuels.
6 Ultimately, two issues must be solved when it comes to trash. First, what do we do with it once we
have it? Second, how do we reduce the amount of it that we have? The fact of the matter is that in
many areas of the country, population densities are high and land is expensive. Hence, a large amount
of trash is produced, and it is expensive to dispose of [7(8(1. globally 2. in a distant place
3. locally). In contrast, there are some areas of the country where there are relatively few people
around to produce garbage, where land for disposal facilities is cheap, and where wide-open spaces
[77] (1. accelerate 2. compound 3. minimize) any potential air-pollution hazards associated with
incinerators. The sensible thing to do, it would seem, is to have the states that produce most of the
trash ship it to states where it can be most efficiently disposed of Å\ [78] (1. for 2. in 3. on) a price,
of course. This is already being done to an extent, but residents of potential recipient states are Å\
[79] (1. broad-mindedly 2. logically speaking 3. not surprisingly)Å\ concerned, lest they end up
being the garbage capitals of the nation. Yet Wisconsin, which imports more than a million tons of
garbage each year, is demonstrating that it is possible to get rid of the trash without trashing the
neighborhood. Landfill operators in Wisconsin are now required to send water monitoring reports to
neighbors and to maintain the landfills for forty years after closure. Operators have also guaranteed
the value of neighboring homes to gain the [80](1. benefit 2. permission 3. safety) of nearby
residents and in some cases have purchased homes to quiet neighbors' objections. These features all
add to the cost of operating landfills, but as long as prospective customers are willing to pay the price
and neighboring residents are satisfied with their protections Å\ and so far these conditions appear to
have been met Å\ it would seem tough to argue with the outcome.

1 Rosie, C-3P0, HAL, WALL-E, Bender, Optimus, Asimo. We have envisioned building humanoid
machines with the ability to walk, talk and think like us Å\ or better than us Å\ since long before the
creation of the microchip.
2 But here's the thing Å\ humanoid robots are never going to happen. To understand why, you have to
understand the shape of the technical problems and compare them to market [1] (1. caps 2. forces
3. locations).
3 First, the mechanics of the human body are spectacularly complex. Sure, we have built machines
[2] (1. for 2. on 3. with) arms and legs, but we are a long way from having a unified platform that can
walk the Earth with the [3] (1. demonstrability 2. integrity 3. dexterity) and reliability of a human.
4 Second, we need major advancements in input/output software. Anyone who's gotten into an
argument with his smartphone can well understand how far we are from having a dependable

ft*GVHnra)
[4] (1. conversation 2. debate 3. lecture) with a machine. It's amusing, if frustrating, to ask one's
phone to "Send Jenn a text" and hear it reply, "What song would you like me to play?" Speaker-
independent, open-ended speech [5](1. breakdown 2. recognition 3. recording) with better than
99 percent reliability isn't part of our near future.
5 TTiird, artificial intelligence is the biggest software challenge in the universe. The human brain's ability
to process information and learn and make decisions is something we can barely understand, [6] (1. let
alone 2. never to 3. only to) reproduce. Reproducing human thought in a controlled situation Å\
like the game of chess Å\ is barely within our grasp. Software that enables machines to act like us,
which requires them to think like us, isn't something we'll be able to develop for generations, if ever.
6 So all we have to do to build a humanoid robot is build a machine to replicate the human form.
Then solve the input/output problem so we always understand each other. And finally, replicate the
thought process of the human brain. Any one of those three tasks is [7] (1. frequently 2. nearly
3. undeniably) impossible. The combination of all three represents one of the greatest technical
r.hallenees known to man.
7
However, it's not just the scale of the technical challenge that makes a humanoid robotic future
impossible; it's the intersection of those three challenges with simple economics.
8 A humanoid robot would be a multipurpose [8] (1. pedestal 2. platform 3. stage) that could do
almost anything. It could do things like get a drink from the fridge or a newspaper from the front
door. But those are sub-$20 problems Å\ meaning realistically you wouldn't pay $20 for someone to
solve those problems for you. That same humanoid robot could do more useful things like vacuum
your house or [9](1. grow 2. replace 3. soothe) your baby or drive your car. Those things are
9
worth more than $20 and we already use robots to solve those problems Å\ they just aren't humanoid.
You can pay $400 for a robot that vacuums your house. For around $250 you can buy an infant seat
to rock your baby. When buying a new car you can select robotic options on the fringe of self-driving
technology, like lane departure warning and collision avoidance and dynamic cruise control.
10 The point is, we don't need to build a humanoid robot to do these things. We can build the robots
into the things themselves.
11 The idea that we'll have robots in the future to assist in daily tasks isn't wrong. The idea that we
need a multipurpose humanoid robot is. As costs continue to [10](1. increase 2. decline 3. soar)
and technology continues to advance, we'll be able to make lots of special-purpose robots to solve real
consumer problems. There's iust no need to make them humanoid.
Å\ Based on Daley, R. (January 2015). The robots are coming Å\ Aren't they? TechCrunch.
In the 1st paragraph, why does the author make a list of robots?
1. To show people's fascination with humanlike robots over many years.
2. To show the great diversity of opinion about robots in society.
3. To set up the target at which modern robotics is aiming.
4. To represent both the good and bad prospects of robots.

3. As an example of the great strides forward we have made in robotics.
4. As a cautionary tale of the dangers of giving machines the power to think.

1. Problems of a domestic variety, such as raising children, and cleaning homes.
2. Problems for which very cheap humanoid robots may one day be developed.
3. Problems which people frequently spend around 20 dollars to solve.
4. Problems that people don't mind solving for themselves.

[16] (1. excuse 2. doubt 3. wonder) that today the Foresight Institute announced Amanda as this
year's awardee of the prestigious 2014 Feynman Prize for Nanotechnology Theory Å\ it's like the
Nobel Prize of the nanoscience world. Not only is Amanda the first Australian in the Prize's 22-year
history to win the award, she's also the first woman, shining a much-needed spotlight on the
achievements of women in science. The award is named after Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist
and Nobel Prize winner from last century: the father of quantum electrodynamics.
2 Amanda's award winning work required the use of powerful supercomputers to make the
[17] (1. least 2. most 3. whole) of decades of big data on tiny nanoscience, gaining insights that
might one day lead to extraordinary, life-changing products. We're thinking: self-cleaning surfaces,
fuel cells for harnessing energy, printable inks that conduct electricity, and new drugs to cure life-
threatening illnesses. These are just some of the incredible possibilities.
3 Just a few years ago, Amanda made a fundamental discovery on diamond nanoparticles, finding
that they have unique electrostatic properties that make them spontaneously arrange into very useful
structures, with huge implications for improving healthcare.
4 Already, her diamond discovery has [18](1. underpinned 2. understood 3. undertaken) the
development of a potentially life-saving chemotherapy treatment that targets brain tumours, created
by the University of California.
5 Among her other research highlights, Amanda developed a new technique for investigating the
shape of nanomaterials including their size, temperature or potential uses in chemistry. This means
we can [19] (1. tailor 2. dress 3. sew) them to make custom-made nanoparticles targeted to specific
application areas.
6 Before Amanda [20] (1. sends 2. sets 3. stands) off for California next month to pick up her
award, she shared with us some more insights about her work at the nanoscale.
7 What do you enjoy most about your job?
8 I enjoy our current move into big data. Going into big data-sets to identify trends between nano
properties and structures is like finding buried treasure. It's exciting when you can see the forest for
the [21] (1. birds 2. grass 3. trees) and get a moment of clarity when all the data collects. Those
moments are really interesting and I look forward to having more of them. I also love that science is
reinventing itself all the time. It never becomes complacent and will always be exciting as it
continually [22](1. devolves 2. evolves 3. revolves). One finding always leads to another question.
9 How does your work impact on product desigjn and development?
10 I use statistics to determine how well certain tiny material structures will perform under specific
conditions. By predicting how imperfections at a molecular level impact on performance, we can
design products with less [23] (1. adaptability to 2. responsibility for 3. susceptibility to) faults
from the outset. We can also design "molecular machines" that can perform more familiar tasks, like
cogs in a watch; they are an [24] (1. integral 2. interpreted 3. interested) component that can
enhance or improve products.
11 What would you say has been the highlight of your career so far?
12 This prize is definitely a career highlight and I'm thrilled! This would have to be up there as a
highlight for anybody working in nanotechnology.
13 What is the biggest challenge you're grappling with at the moment?
14 Implementing our science on the cloud is the biggest technical challenge for us at the moment. The
data is so big and the skillset is so new and so specific. The cloud would provide easy open access to
results amongst our research peers and we need to do this to collaborate and make the most of all the
research data that's available.
15 Where would you like to see your research/science go or lead to in future?
16 I don't want to know. I hope I'm not able to predict where science goes, [25] (1. nevertheless
2. otherwise 3. rather), I want to be surprised by where it takes us next, and enjoy the ride.

1 Science has a poor track record when it comes to comparing our brains to the technology of the day.
Descartes thought that the brain was a kind of hydraulic pump, propelling the spirits of the nervous
system through the body. Freud compared the brain to a steam engine. The neuroscientist Karl
Pribram likened it to a holographic storage device.
2 Many neuroscientists today would add to this list of failed comparisons the idea that the brain is a
computer Å\ just another [61] (1. analogy 2. promise 3. technology) without a lot of substance.
Some of them actively deny that there is much that is useful in the idea; most simply ignore it.
3 Often, when scientists resist the idea of the brain as a computer, they have a particular target in
mind, which you might call the serial, stored-program machine. Here, a program (or "app") is loaded
into a computer's memory, and an algorithm, or recipe, is executed step by step. (Calculate this, then
calculate that, then compare what you found in the first step with what you found in the second, etc.)
But humans don't download apps to their brains, the [62] (1. critics 2. supporters 3. undecided)
note, and the brain's nerve cells are too slow and variable to be a good match for the transistors and
logic gates that we use in modern computers.
4 If the brain is not a serial algorithm-crunching machine, though, what is it? A lot of neuroscientists are
[63] (1. afraid 2. inclined 3. reluctant) to disregard the big picture, focusing instead on understanding
narrow, measurable phenomena (like the mechanics of how calcium ions are trafficked through a single
neuron), without addressing the larger conceptual question of what it is that the brain does.
5 This approach is misguided. Too many scientists have given up on the computer analogy, and far too
little has been offered in its place. In my view, the analogy is due for a [64] (1. rethink 2. rebuttal
3. reaction).
6 To begin with, all the standard arguments about why the brain might not be a computer are pretty
[65] (1. long 2. weak 3. strong). Take the argument that "brains are parallel, but computers are
serial." Critics are right to note that virtually every time a human does anything, many different parts
of the brain are engaged; that's parallel, not serial.
7 But the idea that computers are strictly serial is woefully [66] (1. off the record 2. on the way
3. out of date). Ever since desktop computers became popular, there has always been some degree of
parallelism in computers, with several different computations being performed simultaneously, by
different components, such as the hard-drive controller and the central processor. And the trend over
time in the hardware business has been to make computers more and more parallel, using new
approaches like multicore processors and graphics processing units.
8 Skeptics of the computer metaphor also like to argue that "brains are analog, while computers are
digital." The idea here is that things that are digital operate only with [67] (1. approximate 2. continuous
3. discrete) divisions, as with a digital watch; things that are analog, like an old-fashioned watch, work
on a smooth continuum.
9 But just as either format is possible for a watch, either format is possible for a computer, and many
"digital" computer switches are built out of analog components and processes. Although virtually all
modern computers are digital, most early computers were analog. [68] (1. And 2. Otherwise 3. So)
we still don't really know whether our brains are analog or digital or some mix of the two.
10 Finally, there is a popular argument that human brains are capable of [69] (1. fabricating
2. counteracting 3. generating) emotions, whereas computers are not. But while computers as we
know them clearly lack emotions, that fact itself doesn't mean that emotions aren't the product of
computation. [70] (1. At most 2. On the contrary 3. To that end), neural systems like the amygdala

that modulate emotions appear to work in roughly the same way as the rest of the brain does, which is
to say that they transmit signals and integrate information, and transform inputs into outputs. As any
computer scientist will tell you, that's pretty much what computers do.
11 Of course, whether the brain is a computer is partly a matter of definition. The brain is obviously
not a Macintosh or a PC. And we humans may not have operating systems, either. But there are
many different ways of building a computer.
12 The real payoff in [71] (1. arranging for 2. running from 3. subscribing to) the idea of a brain as a
computer would come from using that idea to profitably guide research. In an article last fall in the
journal Science, two of my colleagues and I endeavored to do just that, suggesting that a particular
kind of computer, known as the field programmable gate array (FPGA), might offer [72](1. a final
2. an intermediate 3. a preliminary) starting point for thinking about how the brain works.
13 FPGAs consist of a large number of "logic block" programs that can be configured, and reconfigured,
individually, to do a [73] (1. deep 2. wide 3. high) range of tasks. One logic block might do
arithmetic, another signal processing, and yet another look things up in a table. The computation of
the whole is a function of how the individual parts are configured. Much of the logic can be executed
in parallel, much like what happens in a brain.
14 Although my colleagues and I don't [74] (1. literally 2. figuratively 3. constantly) think that the
brain is an FPGA, our suggestion is that the brain might similarly consist of highly orchestrated sets of
fundamental building blocks, such as "computational primitives" for constructing sequences, retrieving
information from memory, and routing information between different locations in the brain.
Identifying those building blocks, we believe, could be the Rosetta stone that unlocks the brain.
15 To put this differently, it is unlikely that we will ever be able to directly connect the language of
neurons and synapses to the [75] (1. diversity 2. fantasy 3. regularity) of human behavior, as many
neuroscientists seem to hope. The chasm between brains and behavior is just too [76](1. narrow
2. powerful 3. vast).
16 Our best shot may come instead from [77](1. dividing and conquering 2. ducking and covering
3. twisting and turning). Fundamentally, that may involve two steps: (1) finding some way to connect
the scientific language of neurons and the scientific language of computational primitives (which would
be comparable in computer science to connecting the physics of electrons and the workings of
microprocessors), and (2) finding some way to connect the scientific language of computational primitives
and that of human behavior (which would be comparable to understanding how computer programs
are built out of more basic microprocessor instructions).
17 If neurons are akin to computer hardware, and behaviors are akin to the actions that a computer
performs, computation is likely to be the [78] (1. book 2. glue 3. pin) that binds the two.
18 There is much that we don't know about brains. But we do know that they aren't [79](1. magical
2. natural 3. systematic). They are just exceptionally complex arrangements of matter. Airplanes
may not fly like birds, but they are subject to the same forces of lift and drag. Likewise, there is no
reason to think that brains are [80] (1. compatible with 2. exempt from 3. subject to) the laws of
computation. If the heart is a biological pump, and the nose is a biological filter, the brain is a
biological computer, a machine for processing information in lawful, systematic ways.

their cellphones. Then they sink into cozy chairs and read in silence for an hour. The point of the club
isn't to ( A ) about literature, but to ( B ) from electronic devices and read, uninterrupted. The group
calls itself the Slow Reading Club, and it is part of a movement populated by book lovers who miss old-

Slow readers list numerous benefits to a regular reading habit, saying it improves their ability to

movement echoes revivals of other old-fashioned, time-consuming pursuits that offset the ever-faster
pace of life, such as cooking and knitting by hand.
The benefits of reading from ( D ) through late adulthood have been documented by researchers. A
study of 300 elderly people published by the journal Neurology last year showed that regular ( E ) in

Attempts to revive old reading habits can be seen in many places. Groups in Seattle, Brooklyn,

Which of the following is not cited in the passage as a benefit of old-fashioned reading?
It helps people focus their attention better. (B) It helps people understand others better.
It improves people's vocabulary. (D) It contributes to stress relief.
Which of the following is not true, according to the text?
Reading isn't the only activity that can help reduce memory loss in old age.
Even though reading is recognized to be beneficial, Americans' reading habits seem to be in decline.
It isn't possible to combine the use of modern social media with old-fashioned slow-reading activities.
The widespread use of computers has led us to adopt reading patterns that negatively affect our
understanding of text.
EV Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow it.
U Even after a depression that has wiped out a quarter of its economy, Greece's population is still
not the worst off in the Eurozone*. GDP* per person (a very [,]rough indicator of living standards) in
Greece remains higher than it is in Latvia, and is roughly level with Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and
Slovenia. And income per head is also still much higher than in Brazil, India and China. So why, then,
are the Greeks complaining so much? Why did they have to be rescued when, in a global context, they
are still reasonably well off? Part of the answer is that expectations matter. Research shows that it's
psychologically much more painful to go from something to nothing than it is to go from nothing to
nothing. Thus, ( A ) has made the Greeks so angry is the [2]huge downward shift in their country's
national income in the past five years: it's the change in income, not the absolute level, that matters.
We all have expectation reference points, and this psychology helps to explain a [3]wide range of
economic and social phenomena. Some argue that it's meaningless to talk about "poverty" in
Madvanced countries such as Britain. Those classified as "poor" are not starving or barefoot, as they
were in former times. (a)

TV'Sa They also have access to technologies like smartphones

satellite television that were literally unimaginable to their ancestors. But the expectation reference
point for "poor" people is not the living standards of ^previous generations of poor people, but the
living standards of other people in the country ( B ) they live (or actually, those of other people in that
country ( C ) they come into contact). And changing people's reference points Å\ as the British
government is currently attempting to do by adjusting the technical definition of ^poverty Å\ isn't easy.
Before they vote to change the definition of poverty, MPs* might like to consider that, with their
Åí67,000 annual salary, they are ^objectively better off than most of the population. But the expectation

reference point of MPs is the pay of company executives and ^senior bureaucrats Å\ in other words, those
( D ) they consider their peers. That's why they feel desperately poor and demand higher salaries.
The expectation reference point also explains why migrants from poor countries are prepared to do
jobs that workers in rich countries aren't particularly keen on. Picking apples for the minimum wage in
Britain seems preferable to unemployment in Eastern Europe. Their reference point differs from that of
the native-born population.
An example from history: the living standards of British settlers in America in the late 18th century
were higher than those of the inhabitants of any other British colony, but it was these Americans and
not, for example, the Indians, who rebelled in 1773 and demanded independence. How can we explain
this? The reference point is the answer. •gtlilfc'ffetfAfclb t
gfrfzh b^itmLtzo
Reference points aren't economically "rational". Classical economic models assume we make
decisions based on an objective understanding of ( E ) will make us better or worse off in financial
terms. So in classical economic models, recessions should be short and self-correcting. The kind of
prolonged slump and mass unemployment seen in Greece recently, and also in America during the Great
Depression of the 1930s, should not happen. Wages should fall until companies are able to start [9]hiring
people again, after which unemployment should disappear. But that doesn't usually happen, because the
psychological reference point makes people strongly resist taking a pay [10]Cut, even when this increases
the risk that their company will go bankrupt and they will lose their job. Their reference point of a
certain salary takes on a massive importance. It's not just about money, but dignity: their cash salary is
the personal reference point ( F ) they judge how well off they are. It is important to understand how
these reference points affect people's behavior, but unfortunately, there is sometimes no choice but to
brutally introduce people to the real world.

1. And then there are pain receptors* Å\ nerve bundles with bare endings that fire when we are hurt.
2. One distinguishing trait is that touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and
experiencing it, quite literally, first hand.
3. Touch literally acts on the world and the world reacts.
4. Touch receptors, on the other hand, are scattered throughout the skin and muscle tissue and must
convey their signals by way of the spinal cord**. 
Touch is the mother of all sensory systems. It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest
single-celled organisms*** can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving
closer or pulling away. It is the first sense to emerge while a baby is still in its mother and the last sense
to fade at life's end. I A I The skin of patients in a deep coma**** will respond when touched by a
nurse.
Touch is a special sense in several ways. I B I As one researcher pointed out, while we can hear or
see something from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something through
touch, we must make a move: rub the fabric or pet the cat. In this way, touch is a two-way street, and
that's not true for sight or hearing. If you touch an object, inevitably you change it, move it, or affect it.
r~c~i
Another trait that distinguishes touch is its widespread distribution. Our eyes, ears, noses, and mouths
are clustered together in the head, conveniently close to the brain that interprets their input. 1 D 1
Finally, more than most of the other senses, there are also many distinct classes of touch-related
receptors. I E I Some respond to pressure and others to vibrations, some are sensitive to warmth or
cold, while other touch nerves keep track of where our limbs are and where we are moving. I F I
Like a mother, touch is always hovering somewhere in the perceptual background. Though it is always
complex and at times contradictory, it remains indispensable to our sense of safety and sanity.

HSIg0|Åíi?| Sleepwalking* is the best-known condition of what are called parasomnias**, a broad group
of problems that arise when one part of the brain shows up for work when it is not supposed to or misses
its shift entirely. In most cases, the result is a person who is literally half asleep.
1. In one scene, she sleepwalks into the room where two men are talking. "You see, her eyes are
open," one says when Lady Macbeth walks by. "Aye, but their sense is shut," the other replies.
2. That means that sleepwalkers can have their eyes open and react to the events going on around
them, but have no conscious thought or memory.
3. Though parasomnia, or sleepwalking, wasn't fully understood by scientists as a class of disorders
until the early 1980s, Shakespeare was eerily*** correct in his description of the sleepwalking Lady
Macbeth.
4. When someone is sleepwalking, the parts of the brain that control movement and spatial
awareness are awake, while the parts of the brain responsible for consciousness are still asleep.
As is so often the case, Shakespeare captures the condition in a nutshell****, the eyes are
open and sleepwalkers can respond but their eyes' "sense is shut." Sleepwalkers awaken with no
memory of their actions, their bodies having gone about their business***** without their brains' input,

Is there a difference between telling a lie and stretching the truth or exaggerating? A series
of recent studies suggests that there mav be.
1. But a recent study found that exactly the opposite was true for students who exaggerated their
grades. These researchers found that, oddly enough, the exaggerators became significantly more
relaxed while discussing their grades. "The ones who exaggerated the most appeared the most calm
and confident" on the ratings, one of the researchers said.
2. Psychologists have studied deception from all sides and have found that telling a lie usually puts a
psychological or physical strain on the person doing it. People with guilty knowledge Å\ of a detail
from a crime scene, for example Å\ tend to show signs of stress, as measured by heart and skin
sensors, under pointed questioning.
3. This grade inflation was less an attempt to deceive, the authors concluded, than a reflection of
healthy overconfidence and a statement of aspirations. "It's basically an exercise in projecting the
self toward one's goals," another scientist said. In fact, students who touched up their averages* in
interviews subsequently improved their grades Å\ often by the very amount they had exaggerated.

secrets does, these studies find; and embroiderers** often work to live up to the enhanced self-

fS| VW "Altruism" tg-f
•SB The concept of altruism is ready for retirement.
Not that the phenomenon of helping others and doing good to other people is about to go away Å\ not
at all. On the contrary, the appreciation of the importance of bonds between individuals is on the rise in
the modern understanding of animal and human societies. What needs to go away is the basic idea
behind the concept of altruism Å\ that there is a conflict of interest between helping yourself and helping
others.
The word "altruism" was coined in the 1850s by the great French sociologist Auguste Comte. What it
means is that you do something for other people (the Old French altrui, from the Latin alter), not just
for yourself. i a i This concept is rooted in the notion that human beings (and animals) are dominated
by selfishness and egoism, so that you need a concept to explain why they sometimes behave unselfishly
and kindly to others.
But the reality is different. Humans are deeply bound to other humans, and most actions are mutual
fEXtt 2017 •

and in the interest of both parties (or, in the case of hatred, in the disinterest of both). The starting point
is neither selfishness nor altruism but the state of being bound together. It's an illusion to believe that
you can be happy when no one else is. I B 1 Or that other people will not be affected by your
unhappiness.
Behavioral science and neurobiology* have shown how intimately we're bound. I C I Feelings such
as empathy, sympathy, and compassion are evident in humans and animals alike. mWe're influenced by
the well-beine of others in more wavs than we normallv care to think of. Therefore a simple rule
applies: Everyone feels better
you're well, and you
when everyone is well.
The relationship between the two is the real one. Egoism and its opposite concept, altruism,
  r _
second-order concepts Å\ shadows or even illusions. This applies also to the immediate psychological
level: if helping others fills you with a rewarding "warm glow," as it is called in experimental economics,
is it not also in your own interest to help others? Are you not, then, helping yourself? I D I
Likewise, if you feel better and make more money when you're generous and contribute to the well-
being and resources of other people Å\ as in the welfare societies that, like my own Denmark, became
rich through sharing and equality Å\ then whoever wants to keep everything for himself, with no gift-
giving, no taxpaying**, and no generosity, is just an amateur egoist. ,91Real egoists share.
It's not altruistic to be an altruist Å\ just wise. Helping others is in your own interest. We don't need
a concept to explain that behavior. Auguste Comte's concept is therefore ready for retirement. And we
can all just help each other, without wondering why.

marvels and enhanced scientific insight, not least about notions of temperature and matter itself.
(D The idea of temperature is something we become familiar with at an early age. It is a parental rite to
ensure a baby's room is stiflingly warm, its bathwater is 'just right', and that it learns that some things
are 'Hot! Don't touch'. Later on we associate numbers with different temperature sensations, and
learn that 20Åã C describes a warm day and 37Åã C is a biochemical Mecca.
(D This familiarity makes it difficult to appreciate what an astonishing concept temperature embodies.
Yet if you approach it with the naivete of early natural philosophers such as Galileo, Newton and
Robert Boyle, you will no longer laugh at early notions of heat. Some thought it a kind of fluid, called
caloric, and we still speak of heat 'flowing'. Others thought that cold was caused by the presence of
coldness, sometimes envisaged as 'frigorific atoms'. To the untutored eye, are these ideas any more
absurd than the notion that light is a wave?
c One experiment performed back in 1791 by Swiss physicist Marc-Auguste Pictet illustrates how
baffling even simple things must have seemed. Pictet used two parabolic mirrors facing each other 21
metres apart. Each mirror reflects the light that hits it towards a focal point. He placed a thermometer
at the focus of one mirror and a hot object at the focus of the other. The thermometer showed a rise
• KÅítt2017ÅíHÅ}^AHFp!3HIEÅ‚
-165-
in temperature indicating that 'calorific rays' of some kind were being transmitted Å\ an impressive
experiment. More amazing, when snow was placed at the first focus, the thermometer reading fell
several degrees. Witnesses at the time were reluctant to conclude that snow emitted cooling frigorific
rays, but given knowledge at the time it would have been hard to conclude anything else!
<D Early efforts at measuring temperature were purely empirical. There existed a standardised method
Å\ within each laboratory at least Å\ for determining 'degrees of heat' in a reproducible manner. The
most useful thermometers exploited the thermal expansion of liquids constrained in glass bulbs and narrow
tubes. The level of the liquid was marked at two 'fixed temperatures'. Then, unknown temperatures
were measured as 'degrees of heat' that were etched as a scale between the two fixed points.
c The biggest problem for early workers was a 'thermal catch-22'. The scale-marking process assumes
that the liquid expands an equal amount for every unit rise in temperature. But this assumption
cannot be verified unless one measures the thermal expansion of the liquid, and to do that one
requires... a thermometer.
c By the early 19th century, no solution to this circularity was in sight. Instead, different workers
simply asserted that one thermometer or another was better than the others. Early thermometers
used 'spirit' Å\ essentially brandy Å\ and this was generally inferior to mercury. However, exhaustive
comparisons in the 1840s by French scientist Henri Victor Regnault showed that an 'air thermometer'
Å\ which measures changes in pressure of dry air in a sealed container Å\ was superior to both in its
reproducibility and inter-comparability.
(D Different designs of air thermometer calibrated at the freezing and boiling points of water gave
consistent estimates of temperatures. In contrast, liquid-in-glass thermometers varied in their
performance depending on the properties of glass, and the type of liquid. Slowly the air thermometer,
which was difficult to use, began to be viewed as definitive and was used to calibrate other, more
practical thermometers.
(D Crude as early measurements were, they brought some order to the thermal world. Reproducible
readings aided everything from cooking to industrial processes. But still no one really knew what it
was thev were measuring!
R As practical confusion lessened, theorists could turn their attention to this problem. And William
Thomson, later to become Lord Kelvin, focused on the possibility of constructing a temperature scale
that did not depend on the materials from which thermometers were made Å\ an absolute scale of
temperature. Kelvin's recipe for an absolute temperature scale was obscure, resting on the operation
of an ideal heat engine, first imagined by the French scientist Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot. But a
more powerful and ultimately successful 'meme' was emerging: the explanation of the physical
properties of matter in terms of atoms.
c It is hard to imagine a time when even the greatest scientific pioneers did not understand that
ects are made
temperature is a measure
that heat is the kinetic energy
moving atoms, and that
the speed with which atoms move Å\ specifically the square of the average
molecular speed. Although ideas of this kind were advanced by the likes of John Herapath in 1820
and John James Waterson in 1845, they were roundly rejected by London's Royal Society. Yet by the time
the book Heat: A mode of motion was published by John Tyndall in 1865 the idea was taught as fact.
@ To put this advance into a modern context, consider recent discussions about the existence of the
Higgs particle. This particle is supposed to give rise to the property of matter we call 'mass'Å\ a
property so familiar that most people barely think it needs explanation. Similarly the idea that the
motion of hypothetical atoms was the source of heat was posited but unconfirmed for many years.
The idea that heat needed a microscopic explanation was not obvious, but once established it offered
astonishing insight into the role of atoms in everyday life: when we feel the temperature of a substance
we are literally sensing the 'buzzing' of matter.
@ And once the idea of molecules jiggling within a substance is accepted, the concept of absolute zero
becomes inevitable: it is the temperature at which atoms become completely still.

4. The advancement of scientific endeavors is in no way straightforward, because theoretical
advancement could be preceded by empirical and practical development and new ideas may not
necessarily be immediately accepted in the community.
5. The historical account of thermometer development leads us to suspect that our offspring could
not care less about the names of the scientists and researchers who made remarkable contributions
to the developments of our modern technology.

R How do recommendations for "best practice" come about? Committees of specialists are convened
to draw up guidelines that aim to identify "best practice" for a certain medical condition. The
principle is that guidelines should be drawn from the "best" evidence and crafted by the "best"
scientific experts in the field. These guidelines are a key component of so-called evidence-based
medicine, the idea that clinical practice should be based solely on the results of scientific studies. The
recommendations are presented not only to physicians, but directly to patients, in informational
brochures, on the Internet, and in the media. Guidelines therefore have become one of the most
powerful forces on patient decisions, since the very language used to describe their content is "best"
practice. Advocates of guidelines assert that both doctors and patients should accept their
recommendations as the default option. Some physicians and health policy planners conclude that
patients who deviate from expert recommendations aren't adequately informed or are "irrational."
(D Doctors and patients certainly should consult guidelines since they provide considerable background
information about disorders and treatment options. But, it's important to recognize that guidelines
aren't strictly "scientific." They incorporate biases and subjective judgments. Experts select which
clinical studies to use and which to discard when they formulate their recommendations. Further, all
studies have limitations. They provide results from statistical averages of selected groups of study
subjects. These averages may not be applicable to a particular patient. Even the most rigorous,
inclusive studies cannot address all the variables of age, gender, genetics, lifestyle, diet, and concurrent
medical conditions that make us individuals and often influence how effective a particular treatment
will be or what sorts of side effects we might experience. Many studies exclude the elderly or those
who have coexisting common medical problems. When making their final recommendations about the
need for treatment, experts also apply their subjective judgment about how much risk is worth taking
in order to obtain a certain benefit. Concerns have also been raised by the Institute of Medicine about
potential conflicts of interest, since some experts who write guidelines are consultants to drug and
device companies or private insurers. Finally, guideline committees have an imperative for consensus
and present their recommendations with one voice. As a result, their conclusions usually fail to
mention dissenting opinions that may have arisen among committee members.
(!) It's also important for patients to realize that guidelines aren't engraved in stone; they can change
quickly. A survey of one hundred recommendations from expert committees found that within a year
14 percent were reversed, within two years 23 percent were changed, and fully half were overturned at
five and a half years. The American College of Physicians, representing internists in the United States,
stated in 2010 that all of its guidelines, if not rewritten, should be automatically suspended after five
years. This isn't only because new and better data become available, but also because the composition
of expert committees may change, and with this change, subjective judgments of "utility" or value
may shift. Consider the guidelines that recommended the use of estrogen in virtually all
postmenopausal women to prevent heart disease and dementia. These guidelines were overturned by
new information from the Women's Health Initiative trial. Yet some experts remain critical of this
study and still endorse parts of the earlier guidelines, believing that for some women the "value" of
hormone replacement may be enough to risk the downsides.
c Clearly, more than assessments of scientific evidence, more than extracting numbers from clinical
research, goes into guidelines and their recommendations. The conclusions drawn about what is
"best" necessarily incorporate the "value" or impact of a treatment on quality of life. For every
individual, this impact is always subjective and cannot be distilled from objective data.
(D We believe that all patients should be fully informed about their condition and then asked about
their preferences. Such "informed patient preference" is placed by the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Sciences at the pinnacle of "quality care." To be truly informed, patients should
be aware of the gray zones in medicine. They must keep in mind that guidelines are not purely
scientific and have a significant subjective component.
c In 2010, researchers at the University of Michigan published the results of one of the first national
surveys of medical decisions. The researchers contacted at random by telephone 3,100 adults age
forty and older. Participants were asked a series of questions about common medical conditions they
might have discussed with their doctors. A disturbing finding was that only half the patients stated
they had been asked their preferences about starting medications for elevated blood pressure or a high
cholesterol level. Although guidelines usually have fine print at the bottom asserting that the
recommendations need to be molded to the preferences, values, and goals of the individual patient, we
believe that this statement should be in large print, because patient preference is often not sought.
c There is a creeping paternalism on the part of health care policy makers and insurance companies to
standardize care based on guidelines. To be sure, standardization is appropriate, even essential, in
some areas of medicine, like safety measures and emergency care. But where patient preferences are
involved, standardization is misconceived. Yet, there are powerful incentives, often financial, to
2017 •
168
reward doctors when their patients receive treatment according to guidelines and penalize them when
their patients deviate from the recommendations. Report cards that rate physicians according to
compliance with guidelines are issued by insurers and often made public. We readily see how a
physician might feel caught by these incentives and press patients to make choices that may not reflect
either physician or patient preferences. As a patient, you want to know that your doctor is on your
side, helping you to figure out an individual choice.
R What if you and your physician don't agree about what is the "best" choice? In such settings, as Dr.
Jacques Carter put it, physicians "negotiate" with their patient. But the ultimate choice is always the
patient's, because it is the patient who either enjoys the benefit of a treatment or suffers its side
effects, experiencing each within the context of his or her values and goals in life.

so that he or she can consistently follow them.
EV (Based on Steven Pinker. 2007. "The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human
U Nature.")
R The games people play as they use language are anything but frivolous. They come from the fact
that conversation is a quintessentially social activity. People do things with words Å\ they offer, they
command, they threaten, they proposition Å\ and the things they do necessarily affect the relationships
they have. We choose our words carefully because they have to accomplish two tasks at once: convey
our intentions, and maintain or renegotiate our ties with our fellows.
R Is the avoidance of plain speaking a bug in our mind design, or might it have a deeper rationale Å\ a
rationale that would predict that any social communicator would engage in indirect speech? At first
glance, a rationale might seem unlikely. The whole reason to have a language is to convey
information, and since knowledge is power, it [Q33] to reason that the more information it conveys,
the better. One might naively think that it's always better to know something than not to know it for
the same reason that it's better to be rich than to be poor: if you're rich, you can always give your
money away and be poor. And if you know something, you can always decide to ignore it.
(D Of course, it is a cliche of our times that we suffer from information overload because of the
ubiquity of electronic media. And for fifty years, cognitive scientists have been harping on the
limitations of the brain in processing information. Some have argued that maximizing the rate of
transmission of usable knowledge is a way to manage the flow of information in a conversation.
c But the ultimate reason our speech is so indirect may lie in a different danger of information Å\ not
that we might be overwhelmed by how much there is, but that we might be poisoned by what it says.
The paradox of rational ignorance is that even if we could accommodate as much information as we
wanted, and could always separate the wheat from the chaff, there are certain messages a rational
mind may not want to receive.
(D Sometimes we choose not to know things because we can anticipate that they would have an
uncontrollable effect on our emotions. Some psychologists list some examples. People who haven't
seen a movie or read a book will shun a review that gives away the ending. A basketball fan who
videotapes a game will sequester himself from media outlets so as not to learn the outcome before he
watches it. Many expectant parents choose not to learn the sex of their unborn child, and in countries
ravaged by the selective abortion of girls, divulging the information can be a crime. And most of us
would rather not know the day on which we will die.
c Another reason a rational system might choose to be ignorant is that if it is designed to come to an
unbiased decision, the slightest bit of extraneous information can tip it one way or another. So juries
are prevented from knowing the criminal record of the accused, or information that the police
obtained by illegal means. Scientists test drugs in double-blind studies, where they keep themselves
from knowing who got the drug and who got the placebo. And government contracts are awarded
through sealed bids.
c But the kind of rational ignorance that can best explain why we veil our speech comes from a type
of dilemma in which our own rationality can be turned against us and a unilateral disarmament of
knowledge is the only countermeasure. People are better off if they can't receive a threat. Hence

misbehaving children avoid their parents' glances, state's witnesses may be held incommunicado, and I
know a colleague who kept a nice jacket and perhaps his life because he couldn't understand some
muggers who were threatening him in a heavy accent. Being in possession of a secret makes one
vulnerable to extortion by those who want to know it and to silencing by those who don't want it
known. Hence kidnap victims are better off if they don't see the kidnapper's face, envoys are kept
ignorant of sensitive information for their own safety, and we have the spy-movie cliche, "I could tell
you, but then I would have to kill you." A person with the least information can be in the better
position: if two friends are negotiating over where to have dinner, the one who suggests a restaurant
convenient to her just before her cell phone goes dead will have the shorter walk.
1) Merely being asked certain questions can put a person at a disadvantage, since one answer might be
damaging, the other would be a lie, and a refusal to answer would be a de facto confession that those
are the respondent's two options. Witnesses who exercise their Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination by refusing to answer a question often do incriminate themselves in the court of public
opinion. When a prestigious position is open and the headhunting begins, candidates can't admit to
wanting it, because if it goes to someone else they would be humbled; nor can they say they don't
want it, because that might take them out of the running. They can't even say "No comment," for
why would they have to if they had no interest in the position? During the recent search for a Harvard
dean, the newspapers found that the plausible candidates mysteriously (and incredibly) could not be
reached by their assistants. And of course we have seen many examples in which mutual knowledge
can transform negative information into a damaging loss of face. Many authors refuse to read their
unfavorable reviews so they can honestly say they have no reply to them. Some authors won't read
any of their reviews, [Q41] acquaintances conclude the worst about the ones they avoided.
(D Knowledge, then, can be dangerous because a rational mind may be compelled to use it in rational
ways, allowing malevolent or careless speakers to commandeer our faculties against us. This makes
the expressive power of language a mixed blessing: it lets us learn what we want to know, but it also
lets us learn what we don't want to know. Language is not just a window into human nature but a
fistula: an open wound through which our innards are exposed to an infectious world. It's not
surprising that we expect people to sheathe their words in politeness and innuendo and other forms of
doublespeak.

Of all the characters ever created by authors, artists and cartoonists, few have
lasted so long and have been so well-loved as Rupert the Bear. Rupert made his
first appearance over ninety-five years ago, on the 8th November 1920, in the pages
of the British newspaper, the Daily Express. To this day, Rupert remains a
permanent feature of the paper. Indeed, no other British newspaper can claim a
character that rivals Rupert for popularity or lasting interest.
Mary Tourtel, a children's book illustrator, created Rupert originally for her own
amusement. Mary was the wife of Herbert Tourtel, the night editor of the Daily
Express. Through her husband, Mary learned that the newspaper was looking for
ideas to inspire a regular cartoon series with broad family appeal. However, the
Daily Express struggled to find anything with the right kind of appeal. ,,,Eventually
Mary decided to show the newspaper's editors her drawings of the little bear dressed in his immediately
recognizable patterned trousers. The people at the Daily Express were delighted. They appreciated at
once the charm and popularity of a teddy-bear character for readers of all ages. Right away the Daily
Express readers took Rupert the Bear into their hearts.
At the time, the Daily Express had been desperate to find a new character in order to compete with its
rival, the Daily Mail. The Daily Mail launched a cartoon in 1915 featuring the adventures of a
character called 'Teddy Tail'. Even though 'Teddy' was based on a mouse rather than a bear, the Teddy
stories appealed strongly to Mail readers. The cartoon ran for forty-five years ,.in all, coming to an end

only in 1960. The Express intended Rupert as

their knock-out weapon against Teddy in their never-
When Rupert was introduced to the public for the first time in 1920, it wasn't a very dramatic start.
He appeared, along with songs, in a single frame at the bottom of a page. An editorial note told readers
to look for the next part of the story on the following day. The story, called 'Little Lost Bear', showed
Rupert being sent off shopping by his parents who warned him not to wander away from the path on the
way to the shops. mThis very first printed picture of Rupert established the look that remains unchanged
to this day.
Although Rupert is a bear, he presents a good example of the life of a small boy living with his parents
in a perfect English village called Nutwood, made up of old and very beautiful houses. Rupert's friends
are all lifelong friends with charmingly obvious schoolboy qualities of one kind or another. Mary
represented the earliest of these characters as a badger, dog and elephant, who all show aspects of the
animal to which they are related (determination, loyalty, wisdom, etc.). Mary's storytelling is firmly
based on the famous fairy tales she so enjoyed as a child herself. Importantly, Mary's husband, Herbert,
wrote all of the songs that accompanied each picture story. The deep understanding between this
husband and wife team lies at the heart of much of the magic of Rupert's many early adventures.
In no time at all, Rupert played a key role in the success of the newspaper.

appeared an almost impossible task. However, Å° the newspaper eventually struck gold when they
contacted another extremely talented illustrator, Alfred Bestall. At first, Alfred was unsure whether he

S3 "Some people have argued that babies' brains aren't mmature enough for them to really 'feel'
pain," said researcher Dr. Rebeccah Slater of Oxford University in England. "Our study provides the
first really strong evidence that wthis is not the case. Not only do babies experience pain, but they may
be more sensitive to it than adults," Slater said in a university news report.
The study included 10 healthy infants, aged 1 to 6 days, and 10 healthy adults, aged 23 to 36. All
underwent MRI scans of their brains while they were tapped on the bottom of their feet. The results
showed that 18 of the 20 brain regions that were active in adults in response to pain were also active in
babies. The scans also showed that babies had the same response to a weak tap as adults did to a tap
that was four times stronger, which suggests that babies are much more sensitive to pain than adults, said
the researchers.
"Up until recently, people didn't think it was possible to study pain in babies using MRI, because,
unlike adults, they don't keep still in the scanner," Slater said. "But babies less than a week old move
around much less than older babies. And we found that their parents were able to get them to fall asleep
inside a scanner. ( 4 ), for the first time, we could study pain in the infant brain using MRI," she explained.
This is particularly important when it comes to pain, she said, since babies can't express their
experience of pain in words and it is difficult to ,6lassess pain from visual observations. Slater said babies
undergo painful procedures every day, but there are often no pain management guidelines to help
doctors. The study suggests that if we provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a certain
procedure, then we should think about giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure.

the idea of selling hunting rights has been extremely controversial. Namibia, which has already lost 12
rhinos this year to illegal hunting, is also moving its rhinos to private farms which can better protect them.
For those with no interest in ,,, preserving animals, a rhino is worth more dead than alive. That's
certainly the case for the illegal hunters and their customers, who pay as much as $14,000 a kilogram for
the horn. This price is so high that there is a debate over whether legalizing the selling of rhino horn
would ( 3 ) the illegal trade or merely make the situation worse. Creating a legal market could cause
more demand and drive prices even higher, encouraging illegal hunters even more.
What about the rhino benefits that you can't put a price on? A study last year in the Journal of
Ecology identified the rhino as a key species, playing an absolutely (4) essential role in maintaining the
variety and health of its environment. For 60 years there were no rhinos at all in Kruger National Park,
but since their re-introduction in the 1960s the rhinos have ( 5 ) changed its ecology for the better.
How do you value a rhino, or any other species of animal? The answer will depend on what kind of
value you consider Å\ economic, emotional, or environmental. If we wish to find a way to save these
animals, we must first decide which of these values is most important to us as humans.

"Adventure tourism" has become a new form of holiday experience. Today, holiday makers in most
Western countries have a huge variety of holiday destinations and experiences to choose from. But most
travel agents agree that more and more people are looking for alternatives to the traditional beach
holiday. Peter Evans, of the British company, Lynton Cooper Travel, explains, "Most of our clients are
looking for adventure-based programs. People now seem to mhave tried the beach destinations and they
just don't think sitting on the beach is a unique experience. What we're trying to do is to provide new

and exciting experiences." The kinds of experiences that travel agents like Peter Evans are offering
(2)range from white-water rafting on Africa's Zambezi River, to climbing some of the world's highest
mountains. But, for some people, these activities are not exciting enough. They are turning to what are
known as extreme sports, with names like "sky surfing." The chief attraction of these sports comes from
the risk they carry of injury or death.
Why is it that more and more people want to experience adventure and a sense of danger? Part of the
reason is that the opportunity to do so has increased dramatically in recent years. Travel firms will now
take people almost anywhere in the world, from Mount Everest to the Antarctic.
But frisky though such activities may be, they allow people to expand their horizons, according to
Jerome Smail, editor of a new British magazine dedicated to extreme sports. "The reason why more
people want to do it is because it's a short cut to life experience," he says. "They can pay money and
then experience the kind of excitement that ordinary people ( 3 ) normally experience. I think it's
also because it's a way of escaping the routine nine-to-five lifestyle that a lot of people lead."
Brendan Koerner, a Washington-based journalist, agrees, arguing that the popularity of extreme sports
in America is seen as a reaction against the overly protected, comfortable life that many people live
there. "We live in the society with the largest number of legal disputes in the history of mankind, when
they're taking jungle-gyms and swings out of children's playgrounds for fear of being sued. And there
are all sorts of little rules in American life right now, that are intended to make it as safe as possible."
He thinks this emphasis on safety goes ( 4 ) the American sense of adventure, which began with the
early pioneers and has been kept alive in films. "Look at our Hollywood movies, we've got all sorts of
action stars, and people look around the boring environment of the suburbs and say 'where is my thrill
and danger?'"
And psychologists agree. They believe that people need an element of risk in their lives. Barry
Gunter, Professor of Psychology at Britain's Sheffield University, explains. "Fundamentally, there is a
basic human need for new experiences Å\ to take risks every once in a while Å\ because that's all part of
feeling more capable about how we deal with our environment." This desire to seek out challenges may
sound like a typically male attempt to prove one's courage and nerve. But though young men are the
chief promoters of extreme sports, they attract women, too.
And it's not only travel agents who have been taking advantage of the newthirst for extreme sports.
,,.The soft drink manufacturer, Pepsi, took the concept into a recent advertising campaign aimed at
young people. Pepsi's UK marketing manager, Simon Lowden, believes the extreme sports featured in
the advertisement greatly appeal to young people. "This is what the name of our new drink, Pepsi Max,
suggests: living life to the maximum, living for now. And this is also what extreme sports are all about.
Whether people do them or not, at least they can look up to them and say, 'yes, I'd like to do that.' And
what excitement Å\ ^genuine excitement Å\ you get from it."
